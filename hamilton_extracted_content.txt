Tree Diseases
House & HomeGardens & TreesCity TreesFree Tree GiveawayInvasive SpeciesPesticide AlternativesPrivate TreesRain Barrel SaleStreet Tree Planting ProgramTree DiseasesTree OwnershipWater Efficient Lawns & GardensWatering RestrictionsTar Spot DiseaseOak WiltMagnolia ScaleDon’t worry, it is a very common thing to get yellow or black spots on your maple tree leaves.  This is caused by a fungal disease (Rhystisma acerinum), also known as tar spot. Tar spot is rarely harmful enough to affect the health of trees, but makes trees look unpleasant. Heavy infections can also cause early leaf drop.  The best way to help control the fungus, is to rake and destroy leaves in the fall.What is Tar Spot Disease?Tar spot is a fungal leaf disease that does occur on several plants, but it is most common on maple trees. It does not cause permanent damage to the tree.Tar spot is an unsightly condition on the leaves for maple trees. It starts with small yellow spots on growing leaves, and by late summer these yellow spots expand into large black blotches that look like tar has been dropped on the leaves. This is because a fungal pathogen, Rhytisma acerinum has developed on the leaves of the maple.When the fungus initially infects a leaf, it causes a small 1/3 cm (1/8 inch.) wide yellow spot to form. As the summer weather progresses, that spot spreads, eventually growing up to 2 cm (3/4 inch.) wide. The spreading yellow spot will also change colour as it continues to grow, slowly turning from a yellow-green to a deep, tarry black.  That is why it is referred to as a tar spot.A variety of factors contribute to the spread and recurrence of this fungal infection. Some factors, such as weather, are not able to be controlled. However, there are some ways in which you can help to prevent infection. Proper garden and yard sanitation will help reduce the spread of tar spot. Overwintering in fallen leaves, one of the best practices is the removal of all your maple’s fallen leaves and bagging or composting them to eliminate the closest source of tar spot spores. If you leave the fallen leaves on the ground until spring, the spores on them will likely reinfect the new foliage and start the cycle again.Trees that have trouble with the fungal disease year after year may also be struggling with excessive moisture. You’ll do them a great favour if you increase the grade around them to eliminate standing water and prevent moisture build-up.Young trees may require treatment, especially if other trees have had a lot of their leaf surfaces covered by fungal disease in the recent past. If you’re planting a younger maple in an area prone to the fungal disease, though, applying a fungicide, Safer Defender Garden Fungicide 1L Ready-to-Use or Safer 3-in-1 Garden Spray 1L Ready-to-Use, at bud break and twice again in 7- to 14-day intervals is recommended. Once your tree is well-established and too tall to easily spray, it should be able to fend for itself.Oak wilt is a disease caused by a fungus. It starts with fall colouring out of season—the leaves are wilting and browning, and within a few weeks, the tree is dead. Once a tree has been infected, there is nothing you can do other than remove it promptly to prevent the disease from spreading to nearby healthy oak trees. That’s why it’s so important to know the symptoms of the disease.Health effectsThe first sign of oak wilt is a rapid wilting and browning of the leaves in late spring to early summer, followed by the leaves dropping. This starts at the top of the tree, which is not easy to inspect in tall trees.The browning of the leaves starts at the margins of the leaf at the apex, which is the tip of the leaf. From there it progresses downwards along the margins towards the midrib and the leaf stem. The browned leaves drop to the ground. Another symptom are vertical cracks in the bark with mat-like fungal spores underneath. The bark swells and eventually ruptures from the pressure created by the growing fungus.In the following you might also notice sap beetles. While feeding on the sweet-smelling fungal mat, these beetles, about one-quarter to one-eighth of an inch, pick up the spores and thereby spread the disease further.What homeowners can do to control Oak WiltOaks that belong to the group of red oaks (pin oak, black oak, northern red oak) are more susceptible than white oaks (white oak, bur oak, swamp white oak). There is no way to save an infected oak tree; the only way to deal with oak wilt is prevention. Since the fungus enters the tree through wounds, avoid injuring oaks between April and August. That means no pruning during those months, and careful maneuvering around oak trees with your lawnmower and other power tools.Scale is an animal that appears to have no resemblance to an insect. It has no legs, no eyes, and no readily apparent antennae; and it is hidden under a shell made of its own cast “skins”. Magnolia scale is white and ‘fluffy’.Magnolia Scale lifecycleMagnolia scale is our largest soft scale insect, reaching ½ inch in length.  This scale spends the winter on small twigs as tiny, dark-coloured nymphs.  In the spring, the scales begin to feed, mature, and change colour.  The males, which turn white, are smaller than the females, about 1/8 inch in length, and emerge as tiny, gnat-like insects.  The males mate with the females and then die.  The females turn white to brownish-purple in colour and continue to enlarge through July.Magnolia scale eggs hatch internally and the crawlers emerge from the mother insect. Crawler emergence occurs late summer into early fall.  Insect life cycles are dictated by heat so emergence of crawlers will vary from year to year.   On average crawler emergence occurs from late August through the end of September.  The crawlers move around until they find a suitable feeding site, usually on branches, where they settle down and remain through the winter.  The adult female dies after reproducing, but may remain attached to the stem for many weeks, making the population seem larger than it really is.What homeowners can do to control Magnolia ScaleSurvey your property for egg masses and scrape them off surfaces into soapy water to destroy them.Place your catchment container below the egg massUse your scraper tool to remove the egg mass from the surface. Ensure that all eggs are scraped. Try not to leave any residual eggs in bark ridges or crevices.Empty the contents of your catchment container or bag into a bucket of soapy waterLeave the eggs sitting in the bucket for a day or two, then dispose of the contentsEgg masses can be located high up in trees.

This diverse list provides resilience and diversity in streetscapes.Forestry Investigator’s will complete a site inspection to select a tree that is site appropriate.Tree planting seasonTrees are planted from May to June and September to November each year.Caring for your treeInformation cards are left at each house when a new tree is planted by the City of Hamilton. These cards outline the needs of your new tree and provide contact information for questions.Use these guidelines to keep your tree healthy until it is established:Water the tree the day it is planted using a slow drip until the soil is saturated.Water the tree weekly for the first year from late spring to early fall; after the first year, water the tree weekly only when it hasn’t rained much.Check soil periodically to determine moisture content. Soil should be moist not drenched or muddy.Scratch the surface of the soil to ensure that water has penetrated the root ball and tree pit area. If the soil is dry, water again until moist throughout the root ball.During periods of drought it is especially important to water the new tree to prevent desiccation and wilting.Do not let the planting dry out completely.A tree guard is provided when the tree is planted for protection. Guards protect  trees from mechanical damage from grass trimmers, lawn mowers, bicycles and cars. Severe and repeated mechanical damage can kill a tree.Fertilize during the second year after the tree was planted. Use brand name tree fertilizers and follow the fertilizer manufacturer’s recommended application rates.Keep weed killers, solvents and cleaning agents away from your tree.The Benefits of MulchA newly planted tree’s best friend is mulch. All trees planted through the program are installed with a layer of mulch. It is very important to maintain this layer of mulch as the tree grows. Mulching is one of the most valuable things a homeowner can do for tree’s health. Mulch is any material placed on the soil to conserve moisture and improve growing conditions. Common materials include arborist’s wood chips, bark, pine needles and for added benefits add a mixture of mulch and compost.Insulates the soil helping to provide a buffer from heat and cold temperaturesRetains water helping to keep the roots moistKeeps weeds out to help prevent root competitionPrevents soil compactionReduces lawn mower and string trimmer damageProper MulchingApply a minimum depth of 10 cm (4 inches) to a maximum of 150 cm (60 inches) of mulch over the planting area. The wider the mulch ring, the greater the benefit. Mulch out to the tree’s drip line, if possible.Maintain this level of mulch as the tree grows, expanding the diameter of the mulch to reach the water roots (to the dripline of the tree).Do not pile mulch against the tree trunk. Pull mulch back several inches from the trunk so the base of the trunk and flare are exposed. The mulch-ring shape should resemble a “doughnut” not a “volcano”.If mulch is already present, check the depth. Do not add more if sufficient layers are already in place.Organic mulches are preferred to inorganic materials. Organic mulches should be well-aerated and composted. Avoid sour smelling mulch.Trees as an investmentAlmost everyone knows that trees and other living plants are valuable. They beautify our surroundings, purify our air, act as sound barriers, manufacture precious oxygen, and help us save energy through their cooling shade in summer and their wind reduction in winter.Many people do not realize, however, that plants have a dollar value of their own that can be measured by competent plant appraisers.Tree sizeSometimes the size and age of a tree are such that it cannot be replaced. Trees that are too large to be replaced should be assessed by professionals who use a specialized appraisal formula.Species of TreeTrees that are hardy, durable, highly adaptable and free from objectionable characteristics such as pods or nuts which add to the debris are most valuable and require less maintenance.Condition of the TreeA well-cared-for tree with healthy roots, trunk, branches and buds will have a higher value.Location of the TreeOne tree standing alone will often have a higher value than a tree in a group. A tree near your house, or one which is a focal point in your landscape, tends to have more value.Street Tree Planting ProgramFrequently Asked QuestionsMy city tree has been removed.

Title: parking standards reviewlearn about the comprehensive review of the city’s parking standards to ensure planned and constructed buildings align with the city's vision.
Parking Standards Review
Cybersecurity Incident Response
Parking Standards Review looks at a potential approach that seek to eliminate or reduce parking minimums in some areas of the city, as well as introduce new requirements such as parking for electric vehicles.
Review project details and register for meetings
A Framework for Updated Parking Standards
In August 2023,Council considered a reportwhich outlined potential changes to the City’s Parking Standards and directed staff to engage with the public and stakeholders on the proposed changes. Key directions that are proposed as the basis of new parking standards include the following:
Adopt a geographical-based approach for establishing parking standards which reflects the diverse land use and mode availability/choice that exists across the City;Eliminate minimum parking requirements for developments within areas that are highly transit supportive and are planned to accommodate higher density mixed use development;Maintain minimum parking standards in other areas, but at lower rates to provide greater flexibility and more affordable housing options;Expansion of the use of parking maximums;Introduce requirements to ensure developments are electric vehicle ready;Eliminate residential boulevard parking; and,Maintain or enhance standards for accessible parking.
Proposed Geographies for Parking StandardsThe City of Hamilton is a geographically diverse city comprised of historical towns and neighbourhoods, older suburban neighbourhoods, emerging transit-oriented areas, newer subdivisions, rural areas.A four zone system has been identified for specifying parking requirements.  It is proposed that minimum parking requirements for residential uses be eliminated for Zone A (Blue zone) and lowered for all remaining zones.

Tree Diseases
House & HomeGardens & TreesCity TreesFree Tree GiveawayInvasive SpeciesPesticide AlternativesPrivate TreesRain Barrel SaleStreet Tree Planting ProgramTree DiseasesTree OwnershipWater Efficient Lawns & GardensWatering RestrictionsTar Spot DiseaseOak WiltMagnolia ScaleDon’t worry, it is a very common thing to get yellow or black spots on your maple tree leaves.  This is caused by a fungal disease (Rhystisma acerinum), also known as tar spot. Tar spot is rarely harmful enough to affect the health of trees, but makes trees look unpleasant. Heavy infections can also cause early leaf drop.  The best way to help control the fungus, is to rake and destroy leaves in the fall.What is Tar Spot Disease?Tar spot is a fungal leaf disease that does occur on several plants, but it is most common on maple trees. It does not cause permanent damage to the tree.Tar spot is an unsightly condition on the leaves for maple trees. It starts with small yellow spots on growing leaves, and by late summer these yellow spots expand into large black blotches that look like tar has been dropped on the leaves. This is because a fungal pathogen, Rhytisma acerinum has developed on the leaves of the maple.When the fungus initially infects a leaf, it causes a small 1/3 cm (1/8 inch.) wide yellow spot to form. As the summer weather progresses, that spot spreads, eventually growing up to 2 cm (3/4 inch.) wide. The spreading yellow spot will also change colour as it continues to grow, slowly turning from a yellow-green to a deep, tarry black.  That is why it is referred to as a tar spot.A variety of factors contribute to the spread and recurrence of this fungal infection. Some factors, such as weather, are not able to be controlled. However, there are some ways in which you can help to prevent infection. Proper garden and yard sanitation will help reduce the spread of tar spot. Overwintering in fallen leaves, one of the best practices is the removal of all your maple’s fallen leaves and bagging or composting them to eliminate the closest source of tar spot spores. If you leave the fallen leaves on the ground until spring, the spores on them will likely reinfect the new foliage and start the cycle again.Trees that have trouble with the fungal disease year after year may also be struggling with excessive moisture. You’ll do them a great favour if you increase the grade around them to eliminate standing water and prevent moisture build-up.Young trees may require treatment, especially if other trees have had a lot of their leaf surfaces covered by fungal disease in the recent past. If you’re planting a younger maple in an area prone to the fungal disease, though, applying a fungicide, Safer Defender Garden Fungicide 1L Ready-to-Use or Safer 3-in-1 Garden Spray 1L Ready-to-Use, at bud break and twice again in 7- to 14-day intervals is recommended. Once your tree is well-established and too tall to easily spray, it should be able to fend for itself.Oak wilt is a disease caused by a fungus. It starts with fall colouring out of season—the leaves are wilting and browning, and within a few weeks, the tree is dead. Once a tree has been infected, there is nothing you can do other than remove it promptly to prevent the disease from spreading to nearby healthy oak trees. That’s why it’s so important to know the symptoms of the disease.Health effectsThe first sign of oak wilt is a rapid wilting and browning of the leaves in late spring to early summer, followed by the leaves dropping. This starts at the top of the tree, which is not easy to inspect in tall trees.The browning of the leaves starts at the margins of the leaf at the apex, which is the tip of the leaf. From there it progresses downwards along the margins towards the midrib and the leaf stem. The browned leaves drop to the ground. Another symptom are vertical cracks in the bark with mat-like fungal spores underneath. The bark swells and eventually ruptures from the pressure created by the growing fungus.In the following you might also notice sap beetles. While feeding on the sweet-smelling fungal mat, these beetles, about one-quarter to one-eighth of an inch, pick up the spores and thereby spread the disease further.What homeowners can do to control Oak WiltOaks that belong to the group of red oaks (pin oak, black oak, northern red oak) are more susceptible than white oaks (white oak, bur oak, swamp white oak). There is no way to save an infected oak tree; the only way to deal with oak wilt is prevention. Since the fungus enters the tree through wounds, avoid injuring oaks between April and August. That means no pruning during those months, and careful maneuvering around oak trees with your lawnmower and other power tools.Scale is an animal that appears to have no resemblance to an insect. It has no legs, no eyes, and no readily apparent antennae; and it is hidden under a shell made of its own cast “skins”. Magnolia scale is white and ‘fluffy’.Magnolia Scale lifecycleMagnolia scale is our largest soft scale insect, reaching ½ inch in length.  This scale spends the winter on small twigs as tiny, dark-coloured nymphs.  In the spring, the scales begin to feed, mature, and change colour.  The males, which turn white, are smaller than the females, about 1/8 inch in length, and emerge as tiny, gnat-like insects.  The males mate with the females and then die.  The females turn white to brownish-purple in colour and continue to enlarge through July.Magnolia scale eggs hatch internally and the crawlers emerge from the mother insect. Crawler emergence occurs late summer into early fall.  Insect life cycles are dictated by heat so emergence of crawlers will vary from year to year.   On average crawler emergence occurs from late August through the end of September.  The crawlers move around until they find a suitable feeding site, usually on branches, where they settle down and remain through the winter.  The adult female dies after reproducing, but may remain attached to the stem for many weeks, making the population seem larger than it really is.What homeowners can do to control Magnolia ScaleSurvey your property for egg masses and scrape them off surfaces into soapy water to destroy them.Place your catchment container below the egg massUse your scraper tool to remove the egg mass from the surface. Ensure that all eggs are scraped. Try not to leave any residual eggs in bark ridges or crevices.Empty the contents of your catchment container or bag into a bucket of soapy waterLeave the eggs sitting in the bucket for a day or two, then dispose of the contentsEgg masses can be located high up in trees. Care needs to be taken if trying to access anything aloft, especially if using ladders. Some private tree care companies can be hired to provide this service at heights.Date modifiedJuly 06, 2022
What is Tar Spot Disease?
Tar spot is a fungal leaf disease that does occur on several plants, but it is most common on maple trees. It does not cause permanent damage to the tree.Tar spot is an unsightly condition on the leaves for maple trees. It starts with small yellow spots on growing leaves, and by late summer these yellow spots expand into large black blotches that look like tar has been dropped on the leaves. This is because a fungal pathogen, Rhytisma acerinum has developed on the leaves of the maple.When the fungus initially infects a leaf, it causes a small 1/3 cm (1/8 inch.) wide yellow spot to form. As the summer weather progresses, that spot spreads, eventually growing up to 2 cm (3/4 inch.) wide. The spreading yellow spot will also change colour as it continues to grow, slowly turning from a yellow-green to a deep, tarry black.  That is why it is referred to as a tar spot.
A variety of factors contribute to the spread and recurrence of this fungal infection. Some factors, such as weather, are not able to be controlled. However, there are some ways in which you can help to prevent infection. Proper garden and yard sanitation will help reduce the spread of tar spot. Overwintering in fallen leaves, one of the best practices is the removal of all your maple’s fallen leaves and bagging or composting them to eliminate the closest source of tar spot spores. If you leave the fallen leaves on the ground until spring, the spores on them will likely reinfect the new foliage and start the cycle again.Trees that have trouble with the fungal disease year after year may also be struggling with excessive moisture. You’ll do them a great favour if you increase the grade around them to eliminate standing water and prevent moisture build-up.

Title: parking standards review
Parking Standards Review
Cybersecurity Incident Response
Parking Standards Review looks at a potential approach that seek to eliminate or reduce parking minimums in some areas of the city, as well as introduce new requirements such as parking for electric vehicles.
Review project details and register for meetings
A Framework for Updated Parking Standards
In August 2023,Council considered a reportwhich outlined potential changes to the City’s Parking Standards and directed staff to engage with the public and stakeholders on the proposed changes. Key directions that are proposed as the basis of new parking standards include the following:
Adopt a geographical-based approach for establishing parking standards which reflects the diverse land use and mode availability/choice that exists across the City;Eliminate minimum parking requirements for developments within areas that are highly transit supportive and are planned to accommodate higher density mixed use development;Maintain minimum parking standards in other areas, but at lower rates to provide greater flexibility and more affordable housing options;Expansion of the use of parking maximums;Introduce requirements to ensure developments are electric vehicle ready;Eliminate residential boulevard parking; and,Maintain or enhance standards for accessible parking.
Proposed Geographies for Parking StandardsThe City of Hamilton is a geographically diverse city comprised of historical towns and neighbourhoods, older suburban neighbourhoods, emerging transit-oriented areas, newer subdivisions, rural areas.A four zone system has been identified for specifying parking requirements.  It is proposed that minimum parking requirements for residential uses be eliminated for Zone A (Blue zone) and lowered for all remaining zones.

What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Zoning
Cybersecurity Incident Response
What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Title: zoning by-law amendment (zba)the zoning by-law regulates the use of land. if an owner wants a property changed that deviates the permitted uses or regulations, a zba is required.
Zoning By-law Amendment
Bills 23 & 109 - Development Planning processes are currently under review
Amending a Zoning By-law
A Zoning By-law can be amended to change either the zoning of the land or add special provisions to the zoning designation for a special property. This amending by-law can be as little as changing the zoning designation from one to another, adding a use or changing a zoning by-law requirement.
Minor variance:If a property owner wishes to make a minor change to the Zoning By-law regulations that would differ only slightly from the provisions, the owner may apply to theCommittee of Adjustmentfor a minor variance, rather than a Zoning By-law Amendment. You should discuss this alternative first with Planning staff.

Title: development charge rates & informationallows the city to recover growth-related costs associated with the capital infrastructure within hamilton.
Development Charges
Why Development Charges Exist
Development Charges ease the financial burden on taxpayers to fund new services as a result of growth. Without development charges, the costs for additional infrastructure would be at the expense of existing property owners in the form of higher property taxes and user fees. Most municipalities in Ontario use development charges.
How Development Charges are Determined
TheDevelopment Charges Act, 1997provides Council with the authority to pass a by-law to impose Development Charges. This Actrequires that a Development Charges Background Study be completed. The Background study takes into account:
A forecast of the amount, type and location of development and populationThe historical level of capital service levelsA review of future capital projects to provide for the expected development.
The Development Charges By-law provides for an annual adjustment of Development Charges Rates. The Act and the By-law also provide exemptions for certain types of development.
Treasurer’s Statement
The City Treasurer prepares an annual statement regarding the use of development charges funds and sets out the balance in each of the development charges reserves

What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Land Acknowledgement
The City of Hamilton is situated upon the traditional territories of the Erie, Neutral, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas. This land is covered by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, which was an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabek to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. We further acknowledge that this land is covered by the Between the Lakes Purchase, 1792, between the Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.
Today, the City of Hamilton is home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island (North America) and we recognize that we must do more to learn about the rich history of this land so that we can better understand our roles as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers.

Since then, the LDD moth has expanded its range over much of the eastern United States and Canada. It was first detected in Ontario in 1969 and has quickly spread across southern Ontario. It is now well established throughout southern Ontario and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie.LDD moth larvae or caterpillars will feed on tree leaves. If the larvae population is high, they can defoliate whole trees and forests in a short amount of time. LDD moth prefer oak trees, but will feed on a variety of hardwood tree species. Under normal circumstances, defoliation caused by LDD moth won’t kill a tree. However, trees can decline to the point of death in some cases when defoliation is coupled with dry hot summers or impacted by other forest pests like Spring or Fall Cankerworm.Late instar LDD moth larvaFemale LDD moth laying eggsPupation occurs in a cocoon which can be found on a variety of surfaces including trees, rocks, houses, boats, trailers, fences, picnic tables, and firewood. In 13 to 17 days, the moths emerge. Both sexes have wings, but only the males can fly. The male moth is dark brown to beige, medium-sized, and is a very erratic flyer. The female is mostly white and has a wingspan between 60 to 70 mm. The female lays eggs in masses of 100 to 1000 on tree trunks, branches, houses, fences, etc. as well as under rocks and forest floor debris. The eggs are covered with fine brown hairs from the female’s abdomen. The egg masses will remain all winter and caterpillars will hatch in the spring, from late April to mid-May.How The City is controlling LDD mothsIn the fall of 2022, after the spring aerial treatment program, egg mass surveys were conducted City wide.  The surveys indicated that overall, there are low levels of LDD infestation. The surveys also indicated that there are some persistent pockets of higher infestation. The areas of higher infestation are:Dundas (Dundas Driving Park, Fisher’s Mill Park)Ancaster (Ancaster Community Park)Hamilton (Woodland Cemetery).A localized treatment program will be completed in 2023 in the areas that were determined to have higher infestations.  The treatment program will include ground spraying with Btk, egg mass scraping and tree banding.Bacillus thuringiensis ‘kurstaki’ (Btk), is a soil-borne bacterium that is applied to the leaves of affected trees while caterpillars are in their early instar stage (immature). Within 24-48 hours of ingesting Btk, the bacterium disrupts the caterpillars’ digestive system causing the caterpillars to stop eating. Caterpillars that have ingested Btk will succumb to its effects in just a few days.Sunlight and fungi deteriorate Btk within 1 to 4 days.  This means that Btk has very low residual qualities in the natural environment.Btk requires an alkaline environment in the gut in order to be effective. This means that it does not have any detrimental effects to humans, birds, or bees. Btk can affect other caterpillar species (known as non-target species). But due to its low residual life and the narrow spray window, the non-target impact is expected to be quite low.The City uses a conservative and measured application strategy, with the goal of reducing the population below the 2,500 egg masses per hectare. This program is not intended to eradicate LDD entirely.Members of the public are unlikely to experience any symptoms if inadvertently exposed to Btk spray, and no special precautions are necessary. If you are concerned, you should take reasonable precautions to avoid exposure. During applications of Btk you can avoid exposure using the same strategies you would use to avoid pollen or other airborne materials during days when air quality advisories are issued. You can also avoid exposure by staying indoors with windows and doors shut during the spray period, although this action is not required by health officials. (Health Canada, 2009)To learn more about Btk see theHealth Canada Btk Fact Sheet.LDD Moth Treatment AreaIndividual trees that will be included in the ground spray program are outlined below. They are surrounded by the orange highlighted boundary indicating a hotspot zone. These hotspot zone represents where LDD moth populations are slightly higher than the rest of the city. To find out if you live in a hotspot zone, enter your address or nearby intersection into the search box.The ground sprays will happen between May 25 and June 9. A follow up egg mass survey will be completed in Fall 2023 to assess the LDD moth population.What homeowners can do to control LDD mothsHomeowners are encouraged to monitor their hardwood trees like oaks, maples, beech and walnut for the presence of larvae.June to July - Hand pick caterpillarsHandpicking caterpillars is still one of the most effective ways to help control LDD moths on small newly planted trees, shrubs, and plants. If possible, you can also gently shake the tree, so caterpillars fall from the leaves. Thoroughly inspect the remaining foliage, branches, and trunk for caterpillars, and using gloves, pick them off your tree. Fallen and collected caterpillars should be placed and left to soak in soapy water.What to look for - The caterpillars of LDD moths are dark and hairy. They have five blue dot pairs and six red dot pairs on their back. They go through 4-5 "molting" events where they shed their skin and each time, they get bigger.Late May to Early June - BTK applicationYou can apply a product that contains BTK (Bacillus Thuringiensis “kurstaki”)  to foliage at the early stage of caterpillar development when caterpillars just begin feeding. This is usually around mid-May. The pesticide must be ingested by the caterpillar to be effective.For small trees and shrubs that you can reach, products like Safer® Brand Caterpillar Killer can be purchased at local garden supply stores.April to August - Burlap bandingOnce LDD moth caterpillars grow to about an inch (2.5 cm) in length by mid-June, they will move down the trunk to seek shelter from predators and heat. Reduce the number of larvae on the trees in your yard by trapping them.Step-by-Step InstructionsWrap and secure a piece of burlap cloth around the stem/trunk of your treeTie twine or rope around the center or slightly below the center of the burlapDrape the burlap cloth over the twine or rope so there is an overhang where the caterpillars can crawl underneath to seek shelter during the dayCheck the trap by lifting the overhanging burlap cloth every afternoon and collect any hiding caterpillarsPut them into a bucket of soapy water for 2-3 days to destroy themJuly to August - LDD moth trapStep-by-Step InstructionsYou can purchase the traps at various retail stores or online throughout your areaPut the traps out when the moths are active after coming out of their pupa stage of growth. Only male moths are attracted to the traps.Homemade traps can be created with various designs found on websites. The traps have a bait inside their lid that smells like female LDD moth pheromone for attracting males.Once captured, put the moths in a container of soapy water and leave them for 2-3 days, then dispose of the contents.August to April - Eggs mass removalSurvey your property for egg masses and scrape them off surfaces into soapy water to destroy them.Step-by-Step InstructionsPlace your catchment container below the egg massUse your scraper tool to remove the egg mass from the surface. Ensure that all eggsare scraped. Try not to leave any residual eggs in bark ridges or crevices.Empty the contents of your catchment container or bag into a bucket of soapy waterLeave the eggs sitting in the bucket for 2-3 days, then dispose of the contents.Egg masses can be located high up in trees. Care needs to be taken if trying to access anything aloft, especially if using ladders. Some private tree care companies can be hired to provide this service at heights.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat kinds of trees are most affected by the LDD moth caterpillar?LDD moth caterpillarsprefer the leaves of deciduous hardwood trees like maple, elm and oak. It will also feed on apple, alder, birch, poplar and willow trees. As the caterpillar matures, and population levels increase, it will also begin to attack evergreens such as pine and spruce. LDD moth caterpillars don't appear to like ashes, sycamores, butternuts, black walnuts and dogwoods.How much damage can LDD cause to trees?Tree damage depends on the degree of infestation, past defoliations, the tree's vulnerability and the environment and can range from light to almost complete defoliation. If the tree has been weakened or stressed by other conditions, and attacked repeatedly in recent years, the defoliation can result in the death of the tree.Does LDD have any natural enemies?Yes. Predators include other insects like wasps, flies, beetles, ants and spiders as well as birds such as chickadees, blue jays, robins and nuthatches. Animals such as chipmunks, squirrels and raccoons will also prey on the caterpillar.The wasp that targets the LDD moth is a parasite of the egg. It is now commonly found wherever LDD moths are and has become an important natural control.Also, LDD moth is susceptible to several naturally occurring diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and a virus. The virus and bacteria escalate when populations peak. The LDD moth virus disease is often referred to as “wilt” because dead caterpillars hang in an inverted “V” from tree trunks or foliage.These natural biological controls contribute the most to keeping levels within a normal range and tend to follow 2-3 years after the moth populations peak.What can residents do?Property owners are responsible for managing trees (and pests) on their property. You are encouraged to monitor trees on your property - look for egg masses in winter, caterpillars in spring, and moths in July and August - and take action to remove LDD moths as often as possible.Should property owners consider a commercial insecticide to help control the LDD moth population?During severe infestation an insecticide may be considered a viable option. Homeowners can consider consulting with, and hiring a licensed contractor to apply pesticide sprays or tree injections. Timing of the application and the treatment of the entire canopy is essential to the success of control. You should also be aware that pesticide applications do not produce an instant defense and will not completely eradicate the problem, but can be very effective in reducing the insect population when used appropriately.Why are there still some egg masses on boulevard trees, after the City has been by?Our arborists have worked to remove the egg masses from City trees to reduce the population. It is not possible to eliminate this pest completely as it is well established in our region.  Our overall objective is to reduce numbers. We continue to monitor numbers and will take further action if deemed necessary.My family has been experiencing rashes that we think come from LDD moth caterpillars. What should we do about this?The hairs of the LDD moth caterpillars contain histamine which some people are allergic to. Not everyone will have a reaction if coming in contact with the caterpillar, but it is possible and is a known adverse effect. If you are experiencing any sort of reaction, please contact your family care physician for medical advice.The Emerald Ash Borer is a highly destructive invasive beetle that infests ash trees. It has killed millions of ash trees in North America and poses a major environmental threat to urban and forested areas in Hamilton. It has the potential to destroy Hamilton’s entire Ash tree population by the year 2020.Ash trees are an important part of Hamilton's urban and rural landscape. They are commonly found on city streets, woodlots, windbreaks and forests.How Emerald Ash Borers spreadThe Emerald Ash Borer spreads naturally through beetle flight; the beetle is capable of flying distances of 5 km in search of a host tree. The Emerald Ash Borer is also spread by people moving material infested with the beetle such as firewood and nursery stock. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency regulates the movement of material outside the quarantined area.View the Emerald Ash Borer regulated areas of CanadaIdentifying Ash TreesMountain Ash is not in the same family and is not affected by the Emerald Ash Borer. An Ash tree typically has:Ridged BarkOn mature trees (left), bark is tight and displays patterns of diamond shaped ridges. On young trees (right), bark is relatively smooth.Compound ‘Opposite’ LeavesLeaves contain 5 to 11 leaflets with smooth or toothed margins (tips). Leaflets are positioned opposite with one at the top.SeedsWhen present, seeds usually hang in clusters and are dry and oar-shaped.‘Opposite’ BranchesBranches and buds are directly across from each other rather than staggered. However, due to the death and grooming of individual branches, it is possible that not every branch will be opposite.Identifying Signs of InfestationEmerald Ash Borer larvae feed underneath the bark and block nutrients and water from moving throughout the tree. The tree may be dead within a few years of the initial infestation. Infested ash trees often exhibit the following symptoms:Crown DiebackSeverely attacked trees may exhibit crown dieback as the canopy dies from the top down. Leaves may wilt or turn yellow during the growing season.Bark CracksVertical splits of 7 - 10 cm are often present over larval galleries. These are often more noticeable on young trees that do not already have splits from growth-related expansion.WoodpeckersWoodpeckers feed on the larvae under the bark. Look for increased Woodpecker feedings or signs of their probing in the bark.Exit HolesOnce fully mature, the adult beetles emerge through exit holes they chew through the bark. These holes are distinctly D-shaped and are 3.5 to 4 mm across.TunnelsWinding S-shaped larval tunnels snake under the bark where larvae bore channels. Removing the bark exposes larvae and sawdust-filled galleries.Removal of infected treesWho is responsible for removal of infected trees depends on where the tree is located on your property:Trees in the road allowanceThe City will remove an infested ash tree from your property if it is located within the road allowance. If the tree in your front yard is showing signs of being infested with the emerald ash borer, call 905-546- 2489 to have your tree assessed. The City will plant a replacement tree once the infested tree and stump is removed.Trees on your propertyYou are responsible for all trees that are not on the City’s road allowance. This includes the treatment, removal and disposal of dying or dead Ash trees. Contact an arborist to discuss your options.If you elect to have your tree removed, ensure that the materials are not moved outside the CFIA quarantined area. The wood and mulch can be utilized for firewood and landscape use within this area.Contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency at 1-866-463-6017 orPhytosanitary Requirements to Prevent the Introduction Into and Spread Within Canada of the Emerald Ash Borerfor further information.City Ash treesIn 2012 City Council approved the plan which included the removal of 10% of Hamilton’s Ash tree population each year for a 10 year period. At the current decline rate, it is anticipated the Ash population may be removed in the next four years. Each Ash tree that is removed is replaced with a new species of tree to help diversify Hamilton's urban forest.More information on the Street Tree Planting Program.The City has also been using injectable pesticide on healthy Ash trees of significance. These trees are treated annually during periods of heavy infestation then subsequently every two years. Treating all City-owned Ash trees is not economically feasible.They emerge as adults in October. Adult females are wingless, grayish brown, and about 12 mm long, while the grayish brown, adult male moths have wings with a span of about 30 mm. The adult females climb host trees and shrubs, and mate; each female then lays about 100 eggs on the upper twigs and branches.Health EffectsThese caterpillars can cause significant damage to trees, often causing complete defoliation of a tree. However, a mature, strong tree can survive one to two seasons of complete defoliation. That said, more than three years of defoliation from cankerworm feeding can potentially kill branches.What homeowners can do to control CankerwormsTree banding is an effective method of controlling cankerworms. Adult female cankerworm moths are wingless and need to crawl up the trunks of trees to lay their eggs. Tree bands trap the adult moths as they are crawling up the tree, which usually begins mid-September.  Banding a tree takes just three steps:Wrap a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) wide strip of fibreglass insulation around the trunk approximately 1.5 m (5 ft) off the ground.Cover the insulation with cling wrap. Be sure to wrap it tightly so that the insulation is pushed into the crevices of the bark and to leave a bit of plastic above and below the insulation. This may take two or three layers of cling wrap.Spread a layer of petroleum jelly or a similar sticky substance on the plastic in a band about 10 cm (4 inches) wide.Inspect the band regularly and remove any large debris such as leaves. Reapply the sticky material as required. Be sure to remove all tree bands by mid-December. Leaving tree bands on over the summer can cause mold and rot to develop, causing more harm to the tree than the cankerworms.Giant Hogweed is a non-native invasive plant that poses a serious threat to human health and natural ecosystems. We have found this plant along Spencer Creek and roadways in Dundas. Some plants have been found on private property in Dundas and Flamborough.If you find Giant Hogweed on your property, call 905-546-2489.How to identify Giant HogweedGiant Hogweed looks similar to cow parsnip. It can grow to impressive heights and blossoms.Typical traits of Giant Hogweed:1 to 5.5 metres in height (3 - 15 feet)Large, deeply cut leaves with sharp coarse teeth, reaching widths in excess of 1 m (3 feet)Stems are covered in coarse whisker-like hairs, with red-purple spotsWhite, umbrella shaped flowers up to 1.2 m (4 feet) acrossHealth effectsGiant Hogweed’s leaves and stem produce a watery sap containing a chemical, which makes human skin highly sensitive to the sun and other sources of ultraviolet light. Touching the plant or brushing against it is enough to cause serious injury. Exposed to sunlight, the sap causes painful blistering within a few hours of contact. The healing process can be slow, and your skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for the rest of your life. Blindness may occur if the sap gets into your eye.If any sap touches your skin:wash the affected area immediately with soap and waterkeep the affected area out of the sunsee your doctor if you have a reactionRemoving Giant Hogweed from your propertyFor your own safety, we encourage you to contact a licensed weed exterminator to remove Giant Hogweed from your property.Do not compost Giant Hogweed. Do not put Giant Hogweed out as leaf and yard waste or in your green bin. It is accepted in the garbage if sealed in a bag (no dirt).Report giant hogweed on City propertyThe City has received approval from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment to eradicate Giant Hogweed on road allowances and City maintained trails using a spray herbicide. Red signs warning of herbicide use are posted when used for Giant Hogweed.If you find Giant Hogweed in parks or on trails, call 905-546-2489.Hemlock Woolly Adelgid - Adelges Tsugae (HWA) is a destructive aphid-like pest of eastern hemlock, an ecologically significant tree species in eastern Canada. It feeds on the base of the needles, causing needle drop and tree mortality in as few as 4 years. HWA can be identified by its egg sacs, which look like cotton balls or clumps of snow, and can be found at the base of needles.HWA was identified in Grafton, 200 km north of Hamilton in August 2022.What to do if you think you have identified a Hemlock Woolly Adelgid population?If you believe you have identified HWA on your property contact your local Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Office at 905-572-2201 to have an official identification.

How The City is controlling LDD moths
In the fall of 2022, after the spring aerial treatment program, egg mass surveys were conducted City wide.  The surveys indicated that overall, there are low levels of LDD infestation. The surveys also indicated that there are some persistent pockets of higher infestation. The areas of higher infestation are:
Dundas (Dundas Driving Park, Fisher’s Mill Park)Ancaster (Ancaster Community Park)Hamilton (Woodland Cemetery).
A localized treatment program will be completed in 2023 in the areas that were determined to have higher infestations.  The treatment program will include ground spraying with Btk, egg mass scraping and tree banding.
Bacillus thuringiensis ‘kurstaki’ (Btk), is a soil-borne bacterium that is applied to the leaves of affected trees while caterpillars are in their early instar stage (immature). Within 24-48 hours of ingesting Btk, the bacterium disrupts the caterpillars’ digestive system causing the caterpillars to stop eating. Caterpillars that have ingested Btk will succumb to its effects in just a few days.
Sunlight and fungi deteriorate Btk within 1 to 4 days.  This means that Btk has very low residual qualities in the natural environment.
Btk requires an alkaline environment in the gut in order to be effective. This means that it does not have any detrimental effects to humans, birds, or bees. Btk can affect other caterpillar species (known as non-target species). But due to its low residual life and the narrow spray window, the non-target impact is expected to be quite low.
The City uses a conservative and measured application strategy, with the goal of reducing the population below the 2,500 egg masses per hectare. This program is not intended to eradicate LDD entirely.
Members of the public are unlikely to experience any symptoms if inadvertently exposed to Btk spray, and no special precautions are necessary. If you are concerned, you should take reasonable precautions to avoid exposure. During applications of Btk you can avoid exposure using the same strategies you would use to avoid pollen or other airborne materials during days when air quality advisories are issued. You can also avoid exposure by staying indoors with windows and doors shut during the spray period, although this action is not required by health officials. (Health Canada, 2009)
To learn more about Btk see theHealth Canada Btk Fact Sheet.
LDD Moth Treatment Area
Individual trees that will be included in the ground spray program are outlined below. They are surrounded by the orange highlighted boundary indicating a hotspot zone. These hotspot zone represents where LDD moth populations are slightly higher than the rest of the city. To find out if you live in a hotspot zone, enter your address or nearby intersection into the search box.
The ground sprays will happen between May 25 and June 9. A follow up egg mass survey will be completed in Fall 2023 to assess the LDD moth population.
What homeowners can do to control LDD moths
Homeowners are encouraged to monitor their hardwood trees like oaks, maples, beech and walnut for the presence of larvae.

Title: development charge fees
Development Charges
Why Development Charges Exist
Development Charges ease the financial burden on taxpayers to fund new services as a result of growth. Without development charges, the costs for additional infrastructure would be at the expense of existing property owners in the form of higher property taxes and user fees. Most municipalities in Ontario use development charges.
How Development Charges are Determined
TheDevelopment Charges Act, 1997provides Council with the authority to pass a by-law to impose Development Charges. This Actrequires that a Development Charges Background Study be completed. The Background study takes into account:
A forecast of the amount, type and location of development and populationThe historical level of capital service levelsA review of future capital projects to provide for the expected development.
The Development Charges By-law provides for an annual adjustment of Development Charges Rates. The Act and the By-law also provide exemptions for certain types of development.
Treasurer’s Statement
The City Treasurer prepares an annual statement regarding the use of development charges funds and sets out the balance in each of the development charges reserves

Development Charges
Why Development Charges Exist
Development Charges ease the financial burden on taxpayers to fund new services as a result of growth. Without development charges, the costs for additional infrastructure would be at the expense of existing property owners in the form of higher property taxes and user fees. Most municipalities in Ontario use development charges.
How Development Charges are Determined
TheDevelopment Charges Act, 1997provides Council with the authority to pass a by-law to impose Development Charges. This Actrequires that a Development Charges Background Study be completed. The Background study takes into account:
A forecast of the amount, type and location of development and populationThe historical level of capital service levelsA review of future capital projects to provide for the expected development.
The Development Charges By-law provides for an annual adjustment of Development Charges Rates. The Act and the By-law also provide exemptions for certain types of development.
Treasurer’s Statement
The City Treasurer prepares an annual statement regarding the use of development charges funds and sets out the balance in each of the development charges reserves

What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Since then, the LDD moth has expanded its range over much of the eastern United States and Canada. It was first detected in Ontario in 1969 and has quickly spread across southern Ontario. It is now well established throughout southern Ontario and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie.LDD moth larvae or caterpillars will feed on tree leaves. If the larvae population is high, they can defoliate whole trees and forests in a short amount of time. LDD moth prefer oak trees, but will feed on a variety of hardwood tree species. Under normal circumstances, defoliation caused by LDD moth won’t kill a tree. However, trees can decline to the point of death in some cases when defoliation is coupled with dry hot summers or impacted by other forest pests like Spring or Fall Cankerworm.Late instar LDD moth larvaFemale LDD moth laying eggsPupation occurs in a cocoon which can be found on a variety of surfaces including trees, rocks, houses, boats, trailers, fences, picnic tables, and firewood. In 13 to 17 days, the moths emerge. Both sexes have wings, but only the males can fly. The male moth is dark brown to beige, medium-sized, and is a very erratic flyer. The female is mostly white and has a wingspan between 60 to 70 mm. The female lays eggs in masses of 100 to 1000 on tree trunks, branches, houses, fences, etc. as well as under rocks and forest floor debris. The eggs are covered with fine brown hairs from the female’s abdomen. The egg masses will remain all winter and caterpillars will hatch in the spring, from late April to mid-May.How The City is controlling LDD mothsIn the fall of 2022, after the spring aerial treatment program, egg mass surveys were conducted City wide.  The surveys indicated that overall, there are low levels of LDD infestation. The surveys also indicated that there are some persistent pockets of higher infestation. The areas of higher infestation are:Dundas (Dundas Driving Park, Fisher’s Mill Park)Ancaster (Ancaster Community Park)Hamilton (Woodland Cemetery).A localized treatment program will be completed in 2023 in the areas that were determined to have higher infestations.  The treatment program will include ground spraying with Btk, egg mass scraping and tree banding.Bacillus thuringiensis ‘kurstaki’ (Btk), is a soil-borne bacterium that is applied to the leaves of affected trees while caterpillars are in their early instar stage (immature). Within 24-48 hours of ingesting Btk, the bacterium disrupts the caterpillars’ digestive system causing the caterpillars to stop eating. Caterpillars that have ingested Btk will succumb to its effects in just a few days.Sunlight and fungi deteriorate Btk within 1 to 4 days.  This means that Btk has very low residual qualities in the natural environment.Btk requires an alkaline environment in the gut in order to be effective. This means that it does not have any detrimental effects to humans, birds, or bees. Btk can affect other caterpillar species (known as non-target species). But due to its low residual life and the narrow spray window, the non-target impact is expected to be quite low.The City uses a conservative and measured application strategy, with the goal of reducing the population below the 2,500 egg masses per hectare. This program is not intended to eradicate LDD entirely.Members of the public are unlikely to experience any symptoms if inadvertently exposed to Btk spray, and no special precautions are necessary. If you are concerned, you should take reasonable precautions to avoid exposure. During applications of Btk you can avoid exposure using the same strategies you would use to avoid pollen or other airborne materials during days when air quality advisories are issued. You can also avoid exposure by staying indoors with windows and doors shut during the spray period, although this action is not required by health officials. (Health Canada, 2009)To learn more about Btk see theHealth Canada Btk Fact Sheet.LDD Moth Treatment AreaIndividual trees that will be included in the ground spray program are outlined below. They are surrounded by the orange highlighted boundary indicating a hotspot zone. These hotspot zone represents where LDD moth populations are slightly higher than the rest of the city. To find out if you live in a hotspot zone, enter your address or nearby intersection into the search box.The ground sprays will happen between May 25 and June 9. A follow up egg mass survey will be completed in Fall 2023 to assess the LDD moth population.What homeowners can do to control LDD mothsHomeowners are encouraged to monitor their hardwood trees like oaks, maples, beech and walnut for the presence of larvae.June to July - Hand pick caterpillarsHandpicking caterpillars is still one of the most effective ways to help control LDD moths on small newly planted trees, shrubs, and plants. If possible, you can also gently shake the tree, so caterpillars fall from the leaves. Thoroughly inspect the remaining foliage, branches, and trunk for caterpillars, and using gloves, pick them off your tree. Fallen and collected caterpillars should be placed and left to soak in soapy water.What to look for - The caterpillars of LDD moths are dark and hairy. They have five blue dot pairs and six red dot pairs on their back. They go through 4-5 "molting" events where they shed their skin and each time, they get bigger.Late May to Early June - BTK applicationYou can apply a product that contains BTK (Bacillus Thuringiensis “kurstaki”)  to foliage at the early stage of caterpillar development when caterpillars just begin feeding. This is usually around mid-May. The pesticide must be ingested by the caterpillar to be effective.For small trees and shrubs that you can reach, products like Safer® Brand Caterpillar Killer can be purchased at local garden supply stores.April to August - Burlap bandingOnce LDD moth caterpillars grow to about an inch (2.5 cm) in length by mid-June, they will move down the trunk to seek shelter from predators and heat. Reduce the number of larvae on the trees in your yard by trapping them.Step-by-Step InstructionsWrap and secure a piece of burlap cloth around the stem/trunk of your treeTie twine or rope around the center or slightly below the center of the burlapDrape the burlap cloth over the twine or rope so there is an overhang where the caterpillars can crawl underneath to seek shelter during the dayCheck the trap by lifting the overhanging burlap cloth every afternoon and collect any hiding caterpillarsPut them into a bucket of soapy water for 2-3 days to destroy themJuly to August - LDD moth trapStep-by-Step InstructionsYou can purchase the traps at various retail stores or online throughout your areaPut the traps out when the moths are active after coming out of their pupa stage of growth. Only male moths are attracted to the traps.Homemade traps can be created with various designs found on websites. The traps have a bait inside their lid that smells like female LDD moth pheromone for attracting males.Once captured, put the moths in a container of soapy water and leave them for 2-3 days, then dispose of the contents.August to April - Eggs mass removalSurvey your property for egg masses and scrape them off surfaces into soapy water to destroy them.Step-by-Step InstructionsPlace your catchment container below the egg massUse your scraper tool to remove the egg mass from the surface. Ensure that all eggsare scraped. Try not to leave any residual eggs in bark ridges or crevices.Empty the contents of your catchment container or bag into a bucket of soapy waterLeave the eggs sitting in the bucket for 2-3 days, then dispose of the contents.Egg masses can be located high up in trees. Care needs to be taken if trying to access anything aloft, especially if using ladders. Some private tree care companies can be hired to provide this service at heights.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat kinds of trees are most affected by the LDD moth caterpillar?LDD moth caterpillarsprefer the leaves of deciduous hardwood trees like maple, elm and oak. It will also feed on apple, alder, birch, poplar and willow trees. As the caterpillar matures, and population levels increase, it will also begin to attack evergreens such as pine and spruce. LDD moth caterpillars don't appear to like ashes, sycamores, butternuts, black walnuts and dogwoods.How much damage can LDD cause to trees?Tree damage depends on the degree of infestation, past defoliations, the tree's vulnerability and the environment and can range from light to almost complete defoliation. If the tree has been weakened or stressed by other conditions, and attacked repeatedly in recent years, the defoliation can result in the death of the tree.Does LDD have any natural enemies?Yes. Predators include other insects like wasps, flies, beetles, ants and spiders as well as birds such as chickadees, blue jays, robins and nuthatches. Animals such as chipmunks, squirrels and raccoons will also prey on the caterpillar.The wasp that targets the LDD moth is a parasite of the egg. It is now commonly found wherever LDD moths are and has become an important natural control.Also, LDD moth is susceptible to several naturally occurring diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and a virus. The virus and bacteria escalate when populations peak. The LDD moth virus disease is often referred to as “wilt” because dead caterpillars hang in an inverted “V” from tree trunks or foliage.These natural biological controls contribute the most to keeping levels within a normal range and tend to follow 2-3 years after the moth populations peak.What can residents do?Property owners are responsible for managing trees (and pests) on their property. You are encouraged to monitor trees on your property - look for egg masses in winter, caterpillars in spring, and moths in July and August - and take action to remove LDD moths as often as possible.Should property owners consider a commercial insecticide to help control the LDD moth population?During severe infestation an insecticide may be considered a viable option. Homeowners can consider consulting with, and hiring a licensed contractor to apply pesticide sprays or tree injections. Timing of the application and the treatment of the entire canopy is essential to the success of control. You should also be aware that pesticide applications do not produce an instant defense and will not completely eradicate the problem, but can be very effective in reducing the insect population when used appropriately.Why are there still some egg masses on boulevard trees, after the City has been by?Our arborists have worked to remove the egg masses from City trees to reduce the population. It is not possible to eliminate this pest completely as it is well established in our region.  Our overall objective is to reduce numbers. We continue to monitor numbers and will take further action if deemed necessary.My family has been experiencing rashes that we think come from LDD moth caterpillars. What should we do about this?The hairs of the LDD moth caterpillars contain histamine which some people are allergic to. Not everyone will have a reaction if coming in contact with the caterpillar, but it is possible and is a known adverse effect. If you are experiencing any sort of reaction, please contact your family care physician for medical advice.The Emerald Ash Borer is a highly destructive invasive beetle that infests ash trees. It has killed millions of ash trees in North America and poses a major environmental threat to urban and forested areas in Hamilton. It has the potential to destroy Hamilton’s entire Ash tree population by the year 2020.Ash trees are an important part of Hamilton's urban and rural landscape. They are commonly found on city streets, woodlots, windbreaks and forests.How Emerald Ash Borers spreadThe Emerald Ash Borer spreads naturally through beetle flight; the beetle is capable of flying distances of 5 km in search of a host tree. The Emerald Ash Borer is also spread by people moving material infested with the beetle such as firewood and nursery stock. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency regulates the movement of material outside the quarantined area.View the Emerald Ash Borer regulated areas of CanadaIdentifying Ash TreesMountain Ash is not in the same family and is not affected by the Emerald Ash Borer. An Ash tree typically has:Ridged BarkOn mature trees (left), bark is tight and displays patterns of diamond shaped ridges. On young trees (right), bark is relatively smooth.Compound ‘Opposite’ LeavesLeaves contain 5 to 11 leaflets with smooth or toothed margins (tips). Leaflets are positioned opposite with one at the top.SeedsWhen present, seeds usually hang in clusters and are dry and oar-shaped.‘Opposite’ BranchesBranches and buds are directly across from each other rather than staggered. However, due to the death and grooming of individual branches, it is possible that not every branch will be opposite.Identifying Signs of InfestationEmerald Ash Borer larvae feed underneath the bark and block nutrients and water from moving throughout the tree. The tree may be dead within a few years of the initial infestation. Infested ash trees often exhibit the following symptoms:Crown DiebackSeverely attacked trees may exhibit crown dieback as the canopy dies from the top down. Leaves may wilt or turn yellow during the growing season.Bark CracksVertical splits of 7 - 10 cm are often present over larval galleries. These are often more noticeable on young trees that do not already have splits from growth-related expansion.WoodpeckersWoodpeckers feed on the larvae under the bark. Look for increased Woodpecker feedings or signs of their probing in the bark.Exit HolesOnce fully mature, the adult beetles emerge through exit holes they chew through the bark. These holes are distinctly D-shaped and are 3.5 to 4 mm across.TunnelsWinding S-shaped larval tunnels snake under the bark where larvae bore channels. Removing the bark exposes larvae and sawdust-filled galleries.Removal of infected treesWho is responsible for removal of infected trees depends on where the tree is located on your property:Trees in the road allowanceThe City will remove an infested ash tree from your property if it is located within the road allowance. If the tree in your front yard is showing signs of being infested with the emerald ash borer, call 905-546- 2489 to have your tree assessed. The City will plant a replacement tree once the infested tree and stump is removed.Trees on your propertyYou are responsible for all trees that are not on the City’s road allowance. This includes the treatment, removal and disposal of dying or dead Ash trees. Contact an arborist to discuss your options.If you elect to have your tree removed, ensure that the materials are not moved outside the CFIA quarantined area. The wood and mulch can be utilized for firewood and landscape use within this area.Contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency at 1-866-463-6017 orPhytosanitary Requirements to Prevent the Introduction Into and Spread Within Canada of the Emerald Ash Borerfor further information.City Ash treesIn 2012 City Council approved the plan which included the removal of 10% of Hamilton’s Ash tree population each year for a 10 year period. At the current decline rate, it is anticipated the Ash population may be removed in the next four years. Each Ash tree that is removed is replaced with a new species of tree to help diversify Hamilton's urban forest.More information on the Street Tree Planting Program.The City has also been using injectable pesticide on healthy Ash trees of significance. These trees are treated annually during periods of heavy infestation then subsequently every two years. Treating all City-owned Ash trees is not economically feasible.They emerge as adults in October. Adult females are wingless, grayish brown, and about 12 mm long, while the grayish brown, adult male moths have wings with a span of about 30 mm. The adult females climb host trees and shrubs, and mate; each female then lays about 100 eggs on the upper twigs and branches.Health EffectsThese caterpillars can cause significant damage to trees, often causing complete defoliation of a tree. However, a mature, strong tree can survive one to two seasons of complete defoliation. That said, more than three years of defoliation from cankerworm feeding can potentially kill branches.What homeowners can do to control CankerwormsTree banding is an effective method of controlling cankerworms. Adult female cankerworm moths are wingless and need to crawl up the trunks of trees to lay their eggs. Tree bands trap the adult moths as they are crawling up the tree, which usually begins mid-September.  Banding a tree takes just three steps:Wrap a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) wide strip of fibreglass insulation around the trunk approximately 1.5 m (5 ft) off the ground.Cover the insulation with cling wrap. Be sure to wrap it tightly so that the insulation is pushed into the crevices of the bark and to leave a bit of plastic above and below the insulation. This may take two or three layers of cling wrap.Spread a layer of petroleum jelly or a similar sticky substance on the plastic in a band about 10 cm (4 inches) wide.Inspect the band regularly and remove any large debris such as leaves. Reapply the sticky material as required. Be sure to remove all tree bands by mid-December. Leaving tree bands on over the summer can cause mold and rot to develop, causing more harm to the tree than the cankerworms.Giant Hogweed is a non-native invasive plant that poses a serious threat to human health and natural ecosystems. We have found this plant along Spencer Creek and roadways in Dundas. Some plants have been found on private property in Dundas and Flamborough.If you find Giant Hogweed on your property, call 905-546-2489.How to identify Giant HogweedGiant Hogweed looks similar to cow parsnip. It can grow to impressive heights and blossoms.Typical traits of Giant Hogweed:1 to 5.5 metres in height (3 - 15 feet)Large, deeply cut leaves with sharp coarse teeth, reaching widths in excess of 1 m (3 feet)Stems are covered in coarse whisker-like hairs, with red-purple spotsWhite, umbrella shaped flowers up to 1.2 m (4 feet) acrossHealth effectsGiant Hogweed’s leaves and stem produce a watery sap containing a chemical, which makes human skin highly sensitive to the sun and other sources of ultraviolet light. Touching the plant or brushing against it is enough to cause serious injury. Exposed to sunlight, the sap causes painful blistering within a few hours of contact. The healing process can be slow, and your skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for the rest of your life.

It feeds on the base of the needles, causing needle drop and tree mortality in as few as 4 years. HWA can be identified by its egg sacs, which look like cotton balls or clumps of snow, and can be found at the base of needles.HWA was identified in Grafton, 200 km north of Hamilton in August 2022.What to do if you think you have identified a Hemlock Woolly Adelgid population?If you believe you have identified HWA on your property contact your local Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Office at 905-572-2201 to have an official identification. You can also report a potential invasive pest on theCFIA website.If you have identified a potential HWA population on a street tree or a tree within a City of Hamilton Park or Cemetery, please call the City of Hamilton Contact Center at 905-546-2489.Photo credit: Natural Resource Canada; CFIAFor more information on Hemlock Woolly Adelgid visit Invasive Species CentreThe spotted lanternfly is an invasive insect that can destroy fruit crops and poses a threat to Canadian wine, fruit and forestry industries.

How The City is controlling LDD moths
In the fall of 2022, after the spring aerial treatment program, egg mass surveys were conducted City wide.  The surveys indicated that overall, there are low levels of LDD infestation. The surveys also indicated that there are some persistent pockets of higher infestation. The areas of higher infestation are:
Dundas (Dundas Driving Park, Fisher’s Mill Park)Ancaster (Ancaster Community Park)Hamilton (Woodland Cemetery).
A localized treatment program will be completed in 2023 in the areas that were determined to have higher infestations.  The treatment program will include ground spraying with Btk, egg mass scraping and tree banding.
Bacillus thuringiensis ‘kurstaki’ (Btk), is a soil-borne bacterium that is applied to the leaves of affected trees while caterpillars are in their early instar stage (immature). Within 24-48 hours of ingesting Btk, the bacterium disrupts the caterpillars’ digestive system causing the caterpillars to stop eating. Caterpillars that have ingested Btk will succumb to its effects in just a few days.
Sunlight and fungi deteriorate Btk within 1 to 4 days.  This means that Btk has very low residual qualities in the natural environment.
Btk requires an alkaline environment in the gut in order to be effective. This means that it does not have any detrimental effects to humans, birds, or bees. Btk can affect other caterpillar species (known as non-target species). But due to its low residual life and the narrow spray window, the non-target impact is expected to be quite low.
The City uses a conservative and measured application strategy, with the goal of reducing the population below the 2,500 egg masses per hectare. This program is not intended to eradicate LDD entirely.
Members of the public are unlikely to experience any symptoms if inadvertently exposed to Btk spray, and no special precautions are necessary. If you are concerned, you should take reasonable precautions to avoid exposure. During applications of Btk you can avoid exposure using the same strategies you would use to avoid pollen or other airborne materials during days when air quality advisories are issued. You can also avoid exposure by staying indoors with windows and doors shut during the spray period, although this action is not required by health officials. (Health Canada, 2009)
To learn more about Btk see theHealth Canada Btk Fact Sheet.
LDD Moth Treatment Area
Individual trees that will be included in the ground spray program are outlined below. They are surrounded by the orange highlighted boundary indicating a hotspot zone. These hotspot zone represents where LDD moth populations are slightly higher than the rest of the city. To find out if you live in a hotspot zone, enter your address or nearby intersection into the search box.
The ground sprays will happen between May 25 and June 9. A follow up egg mass survey will be completed in Fall 2023 to assess the LDD moth population.
What homeowners can do to control LDD moths
Homeowners are encouraged to monitor their hardwood trees like oaks, maples, beech and walnut for the presence of larvae.
Frequently Asked Questions
How Emerald Ash Borers spread
The Emerald Ash Borer spreads naturally through beetle flight; the beetle is capable of flying distances of 5 km in search of a host tree. The Emerald Ash Borer is also spread by people moving material infested with the beetle such as firewood and nursery stock. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency regulates the movement of material outside the quarantined area.
View the Emerald Ash Borer regulated areas of Canada
Identifying Ash Trees
Mountain Ash is not in the same family and is not affected by the Emerald Ash Borer. An Ash tree typically has:
Ridged BarkOn mature trees (left), bark is tight and displays patterns of diamond shaped ridges. On young trees (right), bark is relatively smooth.Compound ‘Opposite’ LeavesLeaves contain 5 to 11 leaflets with smooth or toothed margins (tips). Leaflets are positioned opposite with one at the top.
SeedsWhen present, seeds usually hang in clusters and are dry and oar-shaped.‘Opposite’ BranchesBranches and buds are directly across from each other rather than staggered. However, due to the death and grooming of individual branches, it is possible that not every branch will be opposite.
Identifying Signs of Infestation
Emerald Ash Borer larvae feed underneath the bark and block nutrients and water from moving throughout the tree. The tree may be dead within a few years of the initial infestation. Infested ash trees often exhibit the following symptoms:
Crown DiebackSeverely attacked trees may exhibit crown dieback as the canopy dies from the top down. Leaves may wilt or turn yellow during the growing season.Bark CracksVertical splits of 7 - 10 cm are often present over larval galleries. These are often more noticeable on young trees that do not already have splits from growth-related expansion.WoodpeckersWoodpeckers feed on the larvae under the bark. Look for increased Woodpecker feedings or signs of their probing in the bark.
Exit HolesOnce fully mature, the adult beetles emerge through exit holes they chew through the bark. These holes are distinctly D-shaped and are 3.5 to 4 mm across.TunnelsWinding S-shaped larval tunnels snake under the bark where larvae bore channels. Removing the bark exposes larvae and sawdust-filled galleries.
Removal of infected trees
Who is responsible for removal of infected trees depends on where the tree is located on your property:
Trees in the road allowance
The City will remove an infested ash tree from your property if it is located within the road allowance. If the tree in your front yard is showing signs of being infested with the emerald ash borer, call 905-546- 2489 to have your tree assessed. The City will plant a replacement tree once the infested tree and stump is removed.
Trees on your property
You are responsible for all trees that are not on the City’s road allowance. This includes the treatment, removal and disposal of dying or dead Ash trees. Contact an arborist to discuss your options.
If you elect to have your tree removed, ensure that the materials are not moved outside the CFIA quarantined area. The wood and mulch can be utilized for firewood and landscape use within this area.
Contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency at 1-866-463-6017 orPhytosanitary Requirements to Prevent the Introduction Into and Spread Within Canada of the Emerald Ash Borerfor further information.
City Ash trees
In 2012 City Council approved the plan which included the removal of 10% of Hamilton’s Ash tree population each year for a 10 year period. At the current decline rate, it is anticipated the Ash population may be removed in the next four years. Each Ash tree that is removed is replaced with a new species of tree to help diversify Hamilton's urban forest.More information on the Street Tree Planting Program.
The City has also been using injectable pesticide on healthy Ash trees of significance. These trees are treated annually during periods of heavy infestation then subsequently every two years. Treating all City-owned Ash trees is not economically feasible.
Health Effects
These caterpillars can cause significant damage to trees, often causing complete defoliation of a tree. However, a mature, strong tree can survive one to two seasons of complete defoliation. That said, more than three years of defoliation from cankerworm feeding can potentially kill branches.
What homeowners can do to control Cankerworms
Tree banding is an effective method of controlling cankerworms. Adult female cankerworm moths are wingless and need to crawl up the trunks of trees to lay their eggs. Tree bands trap the adult moths as they are crawling up the tree, which usually begins mid-September.  Banding a tree takes just three steps:
Wrap a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) wide strip of fibreglass insulation around the trunk approximately 1.5 m (5 ft) off the ground.Cover the insulation with cling wrap. Be sure to wrap it tightly so that the insulation is pushed into the crevices of the bark and to leave a bit of plastic above and below the insulation. This may take two or three layers of cling wrap.Spread a layer of petroleum jelly or a similar sticky substance on the plastic in a band about 10 cm (4 inches) wide.
Inspect the band regularly and remove any large debris such as leaves. Reapply the sticky material as required. Be sure to remove all tree bands by mid-December. Leaving tree bands on over the summer can cause mold and rot to develop, causing more harm to the tree than the cankerworms.
How to identify Giant Hogweed
Giant Hogweed looks similar to cow parsnip. It can grow to impressive heights and blossoms.
Typical traits of Giant Hogweed:
1 to 5.5 metres in height (3 - 15 feet)Large, deeply cut leaves with sharp coarse teeth, reaching widths in excess of 1 m (3 feet)Stems are covered in coarse whisker-like hairs, with red-purple spotsWhite, umbrella shaped flowers up to 1.2 m (4 feet) across
Health effects
Giant Hogweed’s leaves and stem produce a watery sap containing a chemical, which makes human skin highly sensitive to the sun and other sources of ultraviolet light. Touching the plant or brushing against it is enough to cause serious injury. Exposed to sunlight, the sap causes painful blistering within a few hours of contact. The healing process can be slow, and your skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for the rest of your life. Blindness may occur if the sap gets into your eye.
If any sap touches your skin:
wash the affected area immediately with soap and waterkeep the affected area out of the sunsee your doctor if you have a reaction
Removing Giant Hogweed from your property
For your own safety, we encourage you to contact a licensed weed exterminator to remove Giant Hogweed from your property.
Do not compost Giant Hogweed. Do not put Giant Hogweed out as leaf and yard waste or in your green bin. It is accepted in the garbage if sealed in a bag (no dirt).

Trees are planted in the City-owned road allowance of your property. The measurement of the road allowance varies depending on the survey or neighbourhood you live in.Planting more trees in our neighbourhoods can benefit the city by:Reducing Air Pollution -Street trees improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and intercepting harmful particulates.Fighting Climate Change -Increasing tree cover in towns and cities by just 10% can keep surface temperatures at current levels despite climate change (University of Manchester)Improving Streetscapes -Street trees improve the image of neighbourhoods and make them even better places to live, work and invest.Building Communities -Getting residents involved in caring for trees helps them reconnect with their neighboursBoosting Health -Research shows that children who live in tree-lined streets have lower rates of asthma (Columbia University).Benefiting Wildlife -As well as being great for people, street trees also offer much needed habitat for wildlife too.Additional Benefits -Reduced emissions Increased storm water control Noise abatement Improved health of citizens Beautified neighbourhoods Increased property value.Getting your tree is as easy as 1-2-3!Review the program guidelinesSubmit an online request (form below) orcall 905-546-2489Forestry Investigator will visit site to assess property and tree selection2023 tree requests will be investigated in late 2023 and early 2024 and planted from May to June and September to November 2024.Program GuidelinesThe Street Tree Planting program follows these guidelines:If you live on a standard lot, you can have one tree planted on the road allowance on your property.If you live on a corner lot, you can have up to three trees planted.Trees will not be planted in any boulevard locations where the width of grass area is less than 1.75 metres.Site requirements diagramsSite Requirement Overhead ViewSite Requirement Side ViewNOTESimplified diagrams to be used as a guide only. Forestry staff will confirm planting locations in all situations.Tree selectionIn response to Hamilton’sBiodiversity Action PlanandUrban Forest Strategythe approved species list consists of mainly native shade trees to promote biodiversity and grow the urban tree canopy to 40% by the year 2050. To ensure the urban forest is ready for climate changes the list includes some non-native trees and trees outside their native ranges. This diverse list provides resilience and diversity in streetscapes.Forestry Investigator’s will complete a site inspection to select a tree that is site appropriate.Tree planting seasonTrees are planted from May to June and September to November each year.Caring for your treeInformation cards are left at each house when a new tree is planted by the City of Hamilton. These cards outline the needs of your new tree and provide contact information for questions.Use these guidelines to keep your tree healthy until it is established:Water the tree the day it is planted using a slow drip until the soil is saturated.Water the tree weekly for the first year from late spring to early fall; after the first year, water the tree weekly only when it hasn’t rained much.Check soil periodically to determine moisture content. Soil should be moist not drenched or muddy.Scratch the surface of the soil to ensure that water has penetrated the root ball and tree pit area. If the soil is dry, water again until moist throughout the root ball.During periods of drought it is especially important to water the new tree to prevent desiccation and wilting.Do not let the planting dry out completely.A tree guard is provided when the tree is planted for protection. Guards protect  trees from mechanical damage from grass trimmers, lawn mowers, bicycles and cars. Severe and repeated mechanical damage can kill a tree.Fertilize during the second year after the tree was planted. Use brand name tree fertilizers and follow the fertilizer manufacturer’s recommended application rates.Keep weed killers, solvents and cleaning agents away from your tree.The Benefits of MulchA newly planted tree’s best friend is mulch. All trees planted through the program are installed with a layer of mulch. It is very important to maintain this layer of mulch as the tree grows. Mulching is one of the most valuable things a homeowner can do for tree’s health. Mulch is any material placed on the soil to conserve moisture and improve growing conditions. Common materials include arborist’s wood chips, bark, pine needles and for added benefits add a mixture of mulch and compost.Insulates the soil helping to provide a buffer from heat and cold temperaturesRetains water helping to keep the roots moistKeeps weeds out to help prevent root competitionPrevents soil compactionReduces lawn mower and string trimmer damageProper MulchingApply a minimum depth of 10 cm (4 inches) to a maximum of 150 cm (60 inches) of mulch over the planting area. The wider the mulch ring, the greater the benefit. Mulch out to the tree’s drip line, if possible.Maintain this level of mulch as the tree grows, expanding the diameter of the mulch to reach the water roots (to the dripline of the tree).Do not pile mulch against the tree trunk. Pull mulch back several inches from the trunk so the base of the trunk and flare are exposed. The mulch-ring shape should resemble a “doughnut” not a “volcano”.If mulch is already present, check the depth. Do not add more if sufficient layers are already in place.Organic mulches are preferred to inorganic materials. Organic mulches should be well-aerated and composted. Avoid sour smelling mulch.Trees as an investmentAlmost everyone knows that trees and other living plants are valuable. They beautify our surroundings, purify our air, act as sound barriers, manufacture precious oxygen, and help us save energy through their cooling shade in summer and their wind reduction in winter.Many people do not realize, however, that plants have a dollar value of their own that can be measured by competent plant appraisers.Tree sizeSometimes the size and age of a tree are such that it cannot be replaced. Trees that are too large to be replaced should be assessed by professionals who use a specialized appraisal formula.Species of TreeTrees that are hardy, durable, highly adaptable and free from objectionable characteristics such as pods or nuts which add to the debris are most valuable and require less maintenance.Condition of the TreeA well-cared-for tree with healthy roots, trunk, branches and buds will have a higher value.Location of the TreeOne tree standing alone will often have a higher value than a tree in a group. A tree near your house, or one which is a focal point in your landscape, tends to have more value.Street Tree Planting ProgramFrequently Asked QuestionsMy city tree has been removed.

But your trees are giving you a gift you may want to keep around to help your garden and the environment. Fall leaves on the ground cover up root systems, preserve soil moisture, suppress weeds and other plants. They also slowly break down and return (essential) nutrients to plants, tree fertilizer.You can easily turn those fallen leaves into mulch, even if your lawn mower doesn’t have a mulching function. Adjust the blades to the highest setting and mow right over the leaves.The resulting shredded foliage will slowly break down over the winter, providing nutrients to the grass underneath.TIPDon't leave too thick a layer of leaves on your lawn (particularly bluegrass and fescue) it prevents sunshine from reaching the turf and provides a cozy home for mold, bacteria, pests, and weed seedsWater Efficient Lawn CareWater Efficient PlantsEncourage Deep RootsDon’t think you’re harming your lawn by waiting to water, you’re actually strengthening by encouraging deep roots, as your grass grow deeper roots in search for water.Stress your lawn at the beginning of Spring by delaying watering since spring rain and mild temperatures will sustain your lawn.Your roots will grow deeper and your lawn will become stronger.Soil should be moist 4 to 6 inches below the lawn surface.Provides access to more nutrients (can only access nutrients as far as the roots will reach).Reduces the need for fertilizer.Creates a more drought tolerant lawn.AeratingRemoves small, deep plugs of soil from your lawn.Allows air, water and fertilizer to reach the roots.Rake or mow over the small round cones of soil that are cut out of the ground to break them up.The micro-organisms in the cores will help to decompress thatch and allow your lawn to absorb more moisture, improving water penetration.Watering your lawnWatering your grass at the proper time will result in losing less water to evaporation and keeping more in the soil.Early morning watering allows time for the water to absorb into the soil before the sun comes out.Try not to water in the evening as soil will remain wet most of the night and can cause disease.Most soil diseases require prolonged surface moisture.Shorten watering cycles- Clay soils, slopes and other areas where water runs off quickly, should use short watering cycles on separate days to minimize runoff.Dormant grass -Grasses have a built-in mechanism to slow-down water loss during periods of dry, hot weather.The crowns or growing points of the lawn will remain alive for at least 4 to 6 weeks without water.Once this crown gets moisture again, it will come to life and the turf will green up in 10 to 14 days.Water dormant grass when: the blades don’t spring back upright when you walk on it and when the blades fold to show their lighter blueish green underside.If the lawns receive a lot of traffic while in a dormant state, there will be irreparable damage.Avoid watering heavily and breaking the dormancy and then letting the lawn dry out again.Forcing it back into dormancy can stress the lawn and result in your grass dying.Mowing your lawnKeeping your grass three inches long helps create a healthier, heartier lawn.Longer grass, shades soil and its own roots from the sunAllows the soil to more easily hold moistureChokes out weedsAllows longer roots to developGrass clippings- It's easy to grasscycle with your mower.

In May 2021, amendments were made to the City's Zoning By-laws to permit Additional Dwelling Units (ADUs) in Hamilton.We have a dedicated Additional Dwelling Unit Team to review and issue ADU building permits for existing single family dwellings including up to two internal units & one detached unit.Building Engineering will continue to review multi-residential permits.
What is an Additional Dwelling Unit?
An Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is type of residential unit. It is a separate self-contained unit located on the property of a primary dwelling. The unit may be created within, added to, or detached from the primary dwelling. It is also referred to as a Secondary Dwelling Unit (SDU) within Zoning By-law documents.
Internal ADU
An internal Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a conversion of interior space within an existing dwelling or through a new addition to an existing dwelling to provide one (1) additional dwelling unit to a maximum of four (4) dwelling units in some zones. A new detached dwelling can also be purpose-built to include an internal additional dwelling unit.
Example 1: A basement in an existing dwelling to be converted into a separate residential unit (ADU).Example 2: A new addition constructed to an existing dwelling for the purpose of a separate residential unit (ADU).Example 3: A new house including a layout for a separate self-contained unit within the same building.
Example 4: A single detached dwelling with two (2) new additional dwelling units for a total of three (3) dwelling units. This is multi-residential and will be reviewed by Building Engineering staff.Example 5: A two family dwelling with two (2) new additional dwelling units for a total of four (4) dwelling units. This is multi-residential and will be reviewed by Building Engineering staff.
Detached ADU (D-ADU)
A detached Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a self-contained dwelling unit that is separate from the main dwelling on a lot. It may be newly constructed or created by converting an existing accessory building.
Example 6: A detached garage in the rear yard of a dwelling to be converted into a self-contained residential unit. A new detached building containing a smaller self-contained residential unit on the same property as an existing dwelling.Example 7: More than one ADU permitted on a property. A detached garage in the rear yard of a dwelling to be converted into a self-contained residential unit (Detached ADU) and an additional dwelling unit is constructed on the second floor of the principal dwelling (ADU).
Residential Infill Notice
Refer to theGood Neighbour Guidefor the information notice required for detached additional dwelling units and large additions. This guide also provides requirements and best practices for residential infill construction, as well as communication tips to help everyone involved move smoothly through the project.
Building Permit for Additional Dwelling Unit
Apply In Person
Permit to Construct or Demolish Application Form(PDF, 146.95 KB)
Include the property address, owner/applicant and designer information, including designer schedule.
You will need to ensure all sections of the application form are completed. Schedule 2 would be required on an accompanying permit for sewage/septic system permit applications
Submit application, fees and drawings in person to:City Hall, 3rd Floor71 Main Street WestHamilton, ON
Can I do my own drawings?
As the owner, you may design your own project and produce your own drawings. Libraries and home improvement stores carry books with standard details that can be referenced when creating drawings. Discuss your project with material suppliers to establish costs, sizes and spans. Sample drawings can also be obtained from the Building Division to illustrate the quality of submission necessary for a permit application.
All drawings must be to scale and printed in ink. Original drawings in pencil are not acceptable, but photocopies of penciled drawings may be sufficient. Plans must be fully dimensioned in either metric or imperial units, but not a combination of both. Two (2) copies are required of each drawing.
Delays in the issuance of your permit can arise if your drawing and specification submissions are not complete or do not conform to the Ontario Building Code and/or Zoning By-law.
If you are not familiar with various government regulations, by-laws and Ontario Building Code requirements, you may wish to hire a qualified designer. For more information, seeHiring a Designer For Building Permit Drawings.
You will need to provide a set of architectural drawings, specifications, details and any other relevant information as per proposed ADU to be reviewed for permit application – 2 copies are required for permit submission (one kept on file, one returned with approved building permit).
For an example of the level of quality required for drawing submission, see theADU sample drawings(PDF, 4.15 MB)(to be used for reference only)For details on what is to be included with a building permit submission for an ADU, see theADU Checklist(PDF, 549.63 KB)and refer to specific type of ADU.
Ontario Building Code Requirements
The Ontario Building Code sets out minimum construction standards for how to building an additional dwelling unit. These minimum standards can include but are not limited to these considerations:

Trees are planted in the City-owned road allowance of your property. The measurement of the road allowance varies depending on the survey or neighbourhood you live in.Planting more trees in our neighbourhoods can benefit the city by:Reducing Air Pollution -Street trees improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and intercepting harmful particulates.Fighting Climate Change -Increasing tree cover in towns and cities by just 10% can keep surface temperatures at current levels despite climate change (University of Manchester)Improving Streetscapes -Street trees improve the image of neighbourhoods and make them even better places to live, work and invest.Building Communities -Getting residents involved in caring for trees helps them reconnect with their neighboursBoosting Health -Research shows that children who live in tree-lined streets have lower rates of asthma (Columbia University).Benefiting Wildlife -As well as being great for people, street trees also offer much needed habitat for wildlife too.Additional Benefits -Reduced emissions Increased storm water control Noise abatement Improved health of citizens Beautified neighbourhoods Increased property value.Getting your tree is as easy as 1-2-3!Review the program guidelinesSubmit an online request (form below) orcall 905-546-2489Forestry Investigator will visit site to assess property and tree selection2023 tree requests will be investigated in late 2023 and early 2024 and planted from May to June and September to November 2024.Program GuidelinesThe Street Tree Planting program follows these guidelines:If you live on a standard lot, you can have one tree planted on the road allowance on your property.If you live on a corner lot, you can have up to three trees planted.Trees will not be planted in any boulevard locations where the width of grass area is less than 1.75 metres.Site requirements diagramsSite Requirement Overhead ViewSite Requirement Side ViewNOTESimplified diagrams to be used as a guide only. Forestry staff will confirm planting locations in all situations.Tree selectionIn response to Hamilton’sBiodiversity Action PlanandUrban Forest Strategythe approved species list consists of mainly native shade trees to promote biodiversity and grow the urban tree canopy to 40% by the year 2050. To ensure the urban forest is ready for climate changes the list includes some non-native trees and trees outside their native ranges. This diverse list provides resilience and diversity in streetscapes.Forestry Investigator’s will complete a site inspection to select a tree that is site appropriate.Tree planting seasonTrees are planted from May to June and September to November each year.Caring for your treeInformation cards are left at each house when a new tree is planted by the City of Hamilton. These cards outline the needs of your new tree and provide contact information for questions.Use these guidelines to keep your tree healthy until it is established:Water the tree the day it is planted using a slow drip until the soil is saturated.Water the tree weekly for the first year from late spring to early fall; after the first year, water the tree weekly only when it hasn’t rained much.Check soil periodically to determine moisture content. Soil should be moist not drenched or muddy.Scratch the surface of the soil to ensure that water has penetrated the root ball and tree pit area. If the soil is dry, water again until moist throughout the root ball.During periods of drought it is especially important to water the new tree to prevent desiccation and wilting.Do not let the planting dry out completely.A tree guard is provided when the tree is planted for protection. Guards protect  trees from mechanical damage from grass trimmers, lawn mowers, bicycles and cars. Severe and repeated mechanical damage can kill a tree.Fertilize during the second year after the tree was planted. Use brand name tree fertilizers and follow the fertilizer manufacturer’s recommended application rates.Keep weed killers, solvents and cleaning agents away from your tree.The Benefits of MulchA newly planted tree’s best friend is mulch. All trees planted through the program are installed with a layer of mulch. It is very important to maintain this layer of mulch as the tree grows. Mulching is one of the most valuable things a homeowner can do for tree’s health. Mulch is any material placed on the soil to conserve moisture and improve growing conditions. Common materials include arborist’s wood chips, bark, pine needles and for added benefits add a mixture of mulch and compost.Insulates the soil helping to provide a buffer from heat and cold temperaturesRetains water helping to keep the roots moistKeeps weeds out to help prevent root competitionPrevents soil compactionReduces lawn mower and string trimmer damageProper MulchingApply a minimum depth of 10 cm (4 inches) to a maximum of 150 cm (60 inches) of mulch over the planting area. The wider the mulch ring, the greater the benefit. Mulch out to the tree’s drip line, if possible.Maintain this level of mulch as the tree grows, expanding the diameter of the mulch to reach the water roots (to the dripline of the tree).Do not pile mulch against the tree trunk. Pull mulch back several inches from the trunk so the base of the trunk and flare are exposed. The mulch-ring shape should resemble a “doughnut” not a “volcano”.If mulch is already present, check the depth. Do not add more if sufficient layers are already in place.Organic mulches are preferred to inorganic materials. Organic mulches should be well-aerated and composted. Avoid sour smelling mulch.Trees as an investmentAlmost everyone knows that trees and other living plants are valuable. They beautify our surroundings, purify our air, act as sound barriers, manufacture precious oxygen, and help us save energy through their cooling shade in summer and their wind reduction in winter.Many people do not realize, however, that plants have a dollar value of their own that can be measured by competent plant appraisers.Tree sizeSometimes the size and age of a tree are such that it cannot be replaced. Trees that are too large to be replaced should be assessed by professionals who use a specialized appraisal formula.Species of TreeTrees that are hardy, durable, highly adaptable and free from objectionable characteristics such as pods or nuts which add to the debris are most valuable and require less maintenance.Condition of the TreeA well-cared-for tree with healthy roots, trunk, branches and buds will have a higher value.Location of the TreeOne tree standing alone will often have a higher value than a tree in a group. A tree near your house, or one which is a focal point in your landscape, tends to have more value.Street Tree Planting ProgramFrequently Asked QuestionsMy city tree has been removed.

These cards outline the needs of your new tree and provide contact information for questions.Use these guidelines to keep your tree healthy until it is established:Water the tree the day it is planted using a slow drip until the soil is saturated.Water the tree weekly for the first year from late spring to early fall; after the first year, water the tree weekly only when it hasn’t rained much.Check soil periodically to determine moisture content. Soil should be moist not drenched or muddy.Scratch the surface of the soil to ensure that water has penetrated the root ball and tree pit area. If the soil is dry, water again until moist throughout the root ball.During periods of drought it is especially important to water the new tree to prevent desiccation and wilting.Do not let the planting dry out completely.A tree guard is provided when the tree is planted for protection. Guards protect  trees from mechanical damage from grass trimmers, lawn mowers, bicycles and cars. Severe and repeated mechanical damage can kill a tree.Fertilize during the second year after the tree was planted. Use brand name tree fertilizers and follow the fertilizer manufacturer’s recommended application rates.Keep weed killers, solvents and cleaning agents away from your tree.The Benefits of MulchA newly planted tree’s best friend is mulch. All trees planted through the program are installed with a layer of mulch. It is very important to maintain this layer of mulch as the tree grows. Mulching is one of the most valuable things a homeowner can do for tree’s health. Mulch is any material placed on the soil to conserve moisture and improve growing conditions. Common materials include arborist’s wood chips, bark, pine needles and for added benefits add a mixture of mulch and compost.Insulates the soil helping to provide a buffer from heat and cold temperaturesRetains water helping to keep the roots moistKeeps weeds out to help prevent root competitionPrevents soil compactionReduces lawn mower and string trimmer damageProper MulchingApply a minimum depth of 10 cm (4 inches) to a maximum of 150 cm (60 inches) of mulch over the planting area. The wider the mulch ring, the greater the benefit. Mulch out to the tree’s drip line, if possible.Maintain this level of mulch as the tree grows, expanding the diameter of the mulch to reach the water roots (to the dripline of the tree).Do not pile mulch against the tree trunk. Pull mulch back several inches from the trunk so the base of the trunk and flare are exposed. The mulch-ring shape should resemble a “doughnut” not a “volcano”.If mulch is already present, check the depth. Do not add more if sufficient layers are already in place.Organic mulches are preferred to inorganic materials. Organic mulches should be well-aerated and composted. Avoid sour smelling mulch.Trees as an investmentAlmost everyone knows that trees and other living plants are valuable.

Zoning
Cybersecurity Incident Response
What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Land Acknowledgement
The City of Hamilton is situated upon the traditional territories of the Erie, Neutral, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas. This land is covered by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, which was an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabek to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. We further acknowledge that this land is covered by the Between the Lakes Purchase, 1792, between the Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.
Today, the City of Hamilton is home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island (North America) and we recognize that we must do more to learn about the rich history of this land so that we can better understand our roles as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers.

Title: development charges
Development Charges
Why Development Charges Exist
Development Charges ease the financial burden on taxpayers to fund new services as a result of growth. Without development charges, the costs for additional infrastructure would be at the expense of existing property owners in the form of higher property taxes and user fees. Most municipalities in Ontario use development charges.
How Development Charges are Determined
TheDevelopment Charges Act, 1997provides Council with the authority to pass a by-law to impose Development Charges. This Actrequires that a Development Charges Background Study be completed. The Background study takes into account:
A forecast of the amount, type and location of development and populationThe historical level of capital service levelsA review of future capital projects to provide for the expected development.
The Development Charges By-law provides for an annual adjustment of Development Charges Rates. The Act and the By-law also provide exemptions for certain types of development.
Treasurer’s Statement
The City Treasurer prepares an annual statement regarding the use of development charges funds and sets out the balance in each of the development charges reserves

Land Acknowledgement
The City of Hamilton is situated upon the traditional territories of the Erie, Neutral, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas. This land is covered by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, which was an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabek to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. We further acknowledge that this land is covered by the Between the Lakes Purchase, 1792, between the Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.
Today, the City of Hamilton is home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island (North America) and we recognize that we must do more to learn about the rich history of this land so that we can better understand our roles as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers.

Title: city’s zoning by-laws
Zoning
Cybersecurity Incident Response
What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Please check back in May for more information.Rain Barrel SaleFrequently Asked QuestionsWhy are you having the sale?Rain Barrels are a good way for residents to capture water to be used in gardens and other outdoor uses that normally would go into the sewer. Rain Barrels also help with storm water management by removing the load on the sewer systems during a heavy rainfall.What is the type of rain barrel being sold?The brand is called Sandstone Rain Barrel 240L / 60 Gallon. It is a 1 piece, brand new rain barrel.Can the lid be removed?No, the lid is part of the barrel’s construction. The leaf and mosquito filter basket can be removed.What colours are available?The only colour available for this sale is sandstone, pictured above.How much does it hold and what are its dimensions?The Rain Barrel holds 240L / 60 Gallons and is approximately 38” in height with a 23” diameter.Can multiple rain barrels be linked to each other?Yes, they can by connecting the overflow hose to another barrel.What happens if we get more rain than the barrel can hold?The overflow hose will direct any overflow away from your house. You can also buy multiple barrels and connect them together to capture more water during rain events.How do I store my rain barrel in winter?The barrel should be completely emptied and stored in a garage if possible. If it is left outside make sure it is fully emptied, the tap is open and the top is covered to prevent water from entering or it can be turned up side down for the winter.What are the geographical boundaries for home delivery?The home delivery option is available to all residents with an address within the amalgamated City of Hamilton.Why is home delivery the only option?Home delivery is the only option this year due to uncertainty around COVID-19. By having home delivery we could continue with the sale this year and still offer residents rain barrels at a discounted cost.If home delivery is the only option, why is there a delivery fee?Deliveries are coordinated by rainbarrel.ca and there is no additional fee for delivery.Why is my email required at check-out?The email address is used to send a payment confirmation and may be used to contact you if there is an issue with your delivery.Date modifiedApril 02, 2024

Land Acknowledgement
The City of Hamilton is situated upon the traditional territories of the Erie, Neutral, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas. This land is covered by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, which was an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabek to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. We further acknowledge that this land is covered by the Between the Lakes Purchase, 1792, between the Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.
Today, the City of Hamilton is home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island (North America) and we recognize that we must do more to learn about the rich history of this land so that we can better understand our roles as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers.

Exploring Inclusionary Zoning as an Affordable Housing Tool
The City of Hamilton is exploring the feasibility of adopting a tool known as Inclusionary Zoning to help increase the supply of housing in Hamilton.Before this tool can be adopted, the Province requires the City to conduct a detailed assessment of housing need and the potential impacts Inclusionary Zoning may have on the overall housing market.

The lack of sufficient affordable housing is an issue in Hamilton, across the Province, and more broadly across Canada. The City of Hamilton is exploring the feasibility of adopting a tool known as Inclusionary Zoning to help increase the supply of affordable housing locally.Inclusionary Zoning requires new market rate residential development within a Protected Major Transit Station Area (PMTSA) to include a certain percentage of new affordable housing units. Inclusionary Zoning is one tool that could help increase the supply of more affordable housing units in the City over the long term.View map indicating potential PMTSAs in Hamilton(PDF, 660.72 KB)
How Does Inclusionary Zoning Work in Ontario?
Ontario Regulation 232/18under the Planning Act was enacted in April 2018 by the Province of Ontario. The regulation allows municipalities to secure affordable housing in new residential developments with more than 10 units that are located within a PMTSA.
Inclusionary Zoning policies must be carefully designed to ensure that residential development continues to be viable and does not significantly disrupt the supply of market rate housing. Inclusionary Zoning policies can include a range of measures to reduce the financial impact of providing affordable units on the private development industry. These measures may include phasing in Inclusionary Zoning requirements, establishing more permissive planning regulations (e.g. increased height, increased density, reduced parking requirements etc.), or providing financial incentives, among others.
Before a municipality can adopt an Inclusionary Zoning policy framework, the Province requires municipalities to conduct a detailed assessment of the potential impacts Inclusionary Zoning may have on the overall housing market within the City.

(TSI) for debt collection of these fines.APNs that have been moved to debt collection may not be paid through this website - payments must be made through TSI.  Please use the information you receive from TSI to pay the fine.Administrative Penalty Systems (APS) are an emerging approach to dealing with minor by-law infractions in a manner that is fair, effective and efficient. This approach has been adopted by numerous municipalities, the province, and the federal government, and is designed to streamline the enforcement process and increase compliance with City of Hamilton by-laws.The Administrative Penalty System of enforcement transfers by-law disputes from the courtroom to the municipality through the use of Screening and Hearings Officers who are able to modify, cancel, or affirm penalties. This approach aids in reducing congestion in the courts as well as providing a more local and accessible dispute resolution system. The phasing in of the new APS began in 2017.The APS system currently applies to by-law infractions related to:Business Licensing By-lawMunicipal By-lawsAnimal Ownership By-lawWild LifeHow is the APS more effective?Administrative Penalty Systems allows citizens to:Resolve by-law infraction matters in a more convenient and citizen-friendly environmentRequest an extension of time in which to request a review by a Screening or Hearing OfficerRequest an extension of time to pay a fine from a Screening or Hearing OfficerThe system allows the City to better deal with minor by-law infractions in a timely manner.

In May 2021, amendments were made to the City's Zoning By-laws to permit Additional Dwelling Units (ADUs) in Hamilton.We have a dedicated Additional Dwelling Unit Team to review and issue ADU building permits for existing single family dwellings including up to two internal units & one detached unit.Building Engineering will continue to review multi-residential permits.
What is an Additional Dwelling Unit?
An Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is type of residential unit. It is a separate self-contained unit located on the property of a primary dwelling. The unit may be created within, added to, or detached from the primary dwelling. It is also referred to as a Secondary Dwelling Unit (SDU) within Zoning By-law documents.
Internal ADU
An internal Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a conversion of interior space within an existing dwelling or through a new addition to an existing dwelling to provide one (1) additional dwelling unit to a maximum of four (4) dwelling units in some zones. A new detached dwelling can also be purpose-built to include an internal additional dwelling unit.
Example 1: A basement in an existing dwelling to be converted into a separate residential unit (ADU).Example 2: A new addition constructed to an existing dwelling for the purpose of a separate residential unit (ADU).Example 3: A new house including a layout for a separate self-contained unit within the same building.
Example 4: A single detached dwelling with two (2) new additional dwelling units for a total of three (3) dwelling units. This is multi-residential and will be reviewed by Building Engineering staff.Example 5: A two family dwelling with two (2) new additional dwelling units for a total of four (4) dwelling units. This is multi-residential and will be reviewed by Building Engineering staff.
Detached ADU (D-ADU)
A detached Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a self-contained dwelling unit that is separate from the main dwelling on a lot. It may be newly constructed or created by converting an existing accessory building.
Example 6: A detached garage in the rear yard of a dwelling to be converted into a self-contained residential unit. A new detached building containing a smaller self-contained residential unit on the same property as an existing dwelling.Example 7: More than one ADU permitted on a property. A detached garage in the rear yard of a dwelling to be converted into a self-contained residential unit (Detached ADU) and an additional dwelling unit is constructed on the second floor of the principal dwelling (ADU).
Residential Infill Notice
Refer to theGood Neighbour Guidefor the information notice required for detached additional dwelling units and large additions. This guide also provides requirements and best practices for residential infill construction, as well as communication tips to help everyone involved move smoothly through the project.
Building Permit for Additional Dwelling Unit
Apply In Person
Permit to Construct or Demolish Application Form(PDF, 146.95 KB)

You will need to ensure all sections of the application form are completed. Schedule 2 would be required on an accompanying permit for sewage/septic system permit applications
Submit application, fees and drawings in person to:City Hall, 3rd Floor71 Main Street WestHamilton, ON
Can I do my own drawings?
As the owner, you may design your own project and produce your own drawings. Libraries and home improvement stores carry books with standard details that can be referenced when creating drawings. Discuss your project with material suppliers to establish costs, sizes and spans. Sample drawings can also be obtained from the Building Division to illustrate the quality of submission necessary for a permit application.
All drawings must be to scale and printed in ink. Original drawings in pencil are not acceptable, but photocopies of penciled drawings may be sufficient. Plans must be fully dimensioned in either metric or imperial units, but not a combination of both. Two (2) copies are required of each drawing.
Delays in the issuance of your permit can arise if your drawing and specification submissions are not complete or do not conform to the Ontario Building Code and/or Zoning By-law.
If you are not familiar with various government regulations, by-laws and Ontario Building Code requirements, you may wish to hire a qualified designer. For more information, seeHiring a Designer For Building Permit Drawings.
You will need to provide a set of architectural drawings, specifications, details and any other relevant information as per proposed ADU to be reviewed for permit application – 2 copies are required for permit submission (one kept on file, one returned with approved building permit).
For an example of the level of quality required for drawing submission, see theADU sample drawings(PDF, 4.15 MB)(to be used for reference only)For details on what is to be included with a building permit submission for an ADU, see theADU Checklist(PDF, 549.63 KB)and refer to specific type of ADU.
Ontario Building Code Requirements
The Ontario Building Code sets out minimum construction standards for how to building an additional dwelling unit. These minimum standards can include but are not limited to these considerations:
Building Permit Fees
Building permit feesmust be paid in full at the time of in-person application. You can pay by cash, cheque (payable to the City of Hamilton), debit or credit card. A Building Permit application is not officially complete, even after staff approval, until the City receives payment for the permit.
Note: Only the building permit fees can be paid by credit card.
Development Charges
An Additional Dwelling Unit may be subject to Parkland and Development charges.
All applicable fees are to be determined by the plan reviewer and Financial Team during permit application review.

In May 2021, amendments were made to the City's Zoning By-laws to permit Additional Dwelling Units (ADUs) in Hamilton.We have a dedicated Additional Dwelling Unit Team to review and issue ADU building permits for existing single family dwellings including up to two internal units & one detached unit.Building Engineering will continue to review multi-residential permits.
What is an Additional Dwelling Unit?
An Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is type of residential unit. It is a separate self-contained unit located on the property of a primary dwelling. The unit may be created within, added to, or detached from the primary dwelling. It is also referred to as a Secondary Dwelling Unit (SDU) within Zoning By-law documents.
Internal ADU
An internal Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a conversion of interior space within an existing dwelling or through a new addition to an existing dwelling to provide one (1) additional dwelling unit to a maximum of four (4) dwelling units in some zones. A new detached dwelling can also be purpose-built to include an internal additional dwelling unit.
Example 1: A basement in an existing dwelling to be converted into a separate residential unit (ADU).Example 2: A new addition constructed to an existing dwelling for the purpose of a separate residential unit (ADU).Example 3: A new house including a layout for a separate self-contained unit within the same building.
Example 4: A single detached dwelling with two (2) new additional dwelling units for a total of three (3) dwelling units. This is multi-residential and will be reviewed by Building Engineering staff.Example 5: A two family dwelling with two (2) new additional dwelling units for a total of four (4) dwelling units. This is multi-residential and will be reviewed by Building Engineering staff.
Detached ADU (D-ADU)
A detached Additional Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a self-contained dwelling unit that is separate from the main dwelling on a lot. It may be newly constructed or created by converting an existing accessory building.
Example 6: A detached garage in the rear yard of a dwelling to be converted into a self-contained residential unit. A new detached building containing a smaller self-contained residential unit on the same property as an existing dwelling.Example 7: More than one ADU permitted on a property. A detached garage in the rear yard of a dwelling to be converted into a self-contained residential unit (Detached ADU) and an additional dwelling unit is constructed on the second floor of the principal dwelling (ADU).

What is a Zoning By-law?
A Zoning By-law regulates the use of land. It contains zones for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial and mixed uses, industrial and parks and open space zones.
What zoning means for your property & communityOriginally zoning was used as a tool to protect the health and safety of a community. Zoning would ensure that conflicting land uses were separated such as heavy industry from residential areas. While zoning still serves this purpose today, there is a greater focus on creating mixed use communities and providing enough flexibility through zoning to encourage vibrant holistic places. The Zoning By-law implements Hamilton's long range land use plan known as the Official Plan.

Land Acknowledgement
The City of Hamilton is situated upon the traditional territories of the Erie, Neutral, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas. This land is covered by the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, which was an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabek to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. We further acknowledge that this land is covered by the Between the Lakes Purchase, 1792, between the Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.
Today, the City of Hamilton is home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island (North America) and we recognize that we must do more to learn about the rich history of this land so that we can better understand our roles as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers.

Zoning By-law Amendment
Bills 23 & 109 - Development Planning processes are currently under review
Amending a Zoning By-law
A Zoning By-law can be amended to change either the zoning of the land or add special provisions to the zoning designation for a special property. This amending by-law can be as little as changing the zoning designation from one to another, adding a use or changing a zoning by-law requirement.
Minor variance:If a property owner wishes to make a minor change to the Zoning By-law regulations that would differ only slightly from the provisions, the owner may apply to theCommittee of Adjustmentfor a minor variance, rather than a Zoning By-law Amendment. You should discuss this alternative first with Planning staff.

Inclusionary Zoning
Cybersecurity Incident Response
Exploring Inclusionary Zoning as an Affordable Housing Tool
The City of Hamilton is exploring the feasibility of adopting a tool known as Inclusionary Zoning to help increase the supply of housing in Hamilton.Before this tool can be adopted, the Province requires the City to conduct a detailed assessment of housing need and the potential impacts Inclusionary Zoning may have on the overall housing market.
To follow & provide input, visit engage.hamilton.ca/inclusionaryzoning
The lack of sufficient affordable housing is an issue in Hamilton, across the Province, and more broadly across Canada. The City of Hamilton is exploring the feasibility of adopting a tool known as Inclusionary Zoning to help increase the supply of affordable housing locally.Inclusionary Zoning requires new market rate residential development within a Protected Major Transit Station Area (PMTSA) to include a certain percentage of new affordable housing units. Inclusionary Zoning is one tool that could help increase the supply of more affordable housing units in the City over the long term.View map indicating potential PMTSAs in Hamilton(PDF, 660.72 KB)
How Does Inclusionary Zoning Work in Ontario?
Ontario Regulation 232/18under the Planning Act was enacted in April 2018 by the Province of Ontario. The regulation allows municipalities to secure affordable housing in new residential developments with more than 10 units that are located within a PMTSA.
Inclusionary Zoning policies must be carefully designed to ensure that residential development continues to be viable and does not significantly disrupt the supply of market rate housing. Inclusionary Zoning policies can include a range of measures to reduce the financial impact of providing affordable units on the private development industry. These measures may include phasing in Inclusionary Zoning requirements, establishing more permissive planning regulations (e.g. increased height, increased density, reduced parking requirements etc.), or providing financial incentives, among others.
Before a municipality can adopt an Inclusionary Zoning policy framework, the Province requires municipalities to conduct a detailed assessment of the potential impacts Inclusionary Zoning may have on the overall housing market within the City.

During this time you may experience some inconveniences such as noise, dust, and restricted traffic movement.Every effort will be made to complete the work in a timely manner and to keep any inconvenience to a minimum. We ask for your patience during this period.Sam Lawrence Park is a 7.53 hectare (18.6 acre) park situated at the top of the Niagara Escarpment where the Jolley Cut meets Concession Street and Upper Wellington Street. It is best known for its panoramic views of the Lower City, the Dundas Valley, and Lake Ontario.The City is planning for future park upgrades to Sam Lawrence Park. In September 2020, Hamilton City Council approved the Sam Lawrence Park Master Plan, led by a team of City staff and consultants. The Master Plan is an important first step in considering existing and future uses for the park.Many of Sam Lawrence Park’s existing features are in decline due to age, weathering, slope movements and vandalism and are in need of upgrade. As such, the City has the opportunity to re-examine the park’s existing uses and re-imagine future uses, through a Master Plan process: a process that was last undertaken in 1994. As the City and region continue to grow, this valued public space will take on more significance as a prominent city-wide park, serving local residents and those in the Hamilton region. The outcome of the Master Plan will serve as the blueprint for future park improvements in both the short term and long term.Project DetailsTimeline & ProgressDocumentsDesign ConceptGeneral, site-wide improvements that would be included in the preferred design concept:Improved PavingNew Furnishings (benches, trash receptacles, etc.)New Lighting StrategyNew Interpretive / Way-finding SignageRepair Masonry Walls, Railings and StepsUpdate Servicing (as required)Prune Vegetation to Open ViewsTree Planting PlanStreet Tree Planting along Concession Street.Invasive Species Management PlanEscarpment Slope StabilizationArkledun Avenue & Bruce Trail AccessAll design concept alternatives propose improvements to the Arkledun Avenue and Bruce Trail access connection to Concession Street and Sam Lawrence Park.
